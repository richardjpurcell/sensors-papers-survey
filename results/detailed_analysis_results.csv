[14] it greatly reduces the number of parameters in the network when compared to the network with google created the mobilenet v2 model, which was pre- ordinary convolutions of the same depth. as a result, trained on the imagenet dataset with 1.4 million images and lightweight deep neural networks are developed. it is very 1000 image classes. this model will be used as the basis useful for mobile and edge vision applications. as the size of model to train on the forest fire dataset. the output from the the model decreases, the number of parameters present in the convolution layers of the mobilenet is flattened to form a model also decreases. a depthwise separable convolution dense output. this is fed as input to a custom dense model. generally involves two operations, this dense model is made up of 5 middle layers with a different number of neurons in each layer and an output later 1. depthwise convolution with a single neuron and a sigmoid activation function. the 2. pointwise convolution three middle layers of the custom model have l2 regularization in them. this prevents the model from overfitting the training set. a). overfitting and regularization overfitting occurs when a model exactly matches its training data. when this happens, the classifier is unable to efficiently predict against unknown data, defeating its purpose. the ability to generalize a model is subsequently what enables machine learning algorithms to make predictions and categorize data. regularization fine-tunes the function of the model by including an additional penalty term in the error function. the extra term regulates the highly fluctuating function, preventing the coefficients from taking extreme values. l2 regularization, commonly known as ridge figure 5: accuracy vs multiply-accumulates of different regularization, is one of several strategies for preventing a models model from overfitting the training set. in ridge regression, 978-1-6654-7971-4/22/$, $31.00  2022 ieee 1099 authorized licensed use limited to: dalhousie university. downloaded on december 27,2024 at 17:33:49 utc from ieee xplore. restrictions apply. proceedings of the third international conference on electronics and sustainable communication systems (icesc 2022) ieee xplore part number: cfp22v66-art;

[12] this technique parameters are tweaked using the optimizer or the attempts to alter the weights such that the successive optimization function so that the model reaches coverage. at evaluations decrease the error, implying that the optimization the end of each epoch, the validation data is passed to the process is travelling down the error gradient. model to assess its performance. in an optimization problem, the objective function is colaboratory, abbreviated ""colab,"" is a google used to evaluate a proposed solution (i.e., a sequence of research product. colab is a python editor which is similar to weights). it is possible to maximize or minimize the objective jupyter notebooks. this runs on the web through google's function. this suggests that the objective function is looking cloud servers. colab allows writing and executing python for an ideal solution with a greatest or a lowest score. code very easily. it is especially beneficial for education and typically, the goal of neural networks is to reduce the error. research in the fields of data science, ai, etc. colab needs no so, the objective function is often referred to as a loss function 978-1-6654-7971-4/22/$, $31.00  2022 ieee 1101 authorized licensed use limited to: dalhousie university. downloaded on december 27,2024 at 17:33:49 utc from ieee xplore. restrictions apply. proceedings of the third international conference on electronics and sustainable communication systems (icesc 2022) ieee xplore part number: cfp22v66-art;

outdoor sports monitoring, monitoring of highways,bridges,andothercivilinfrastructure(zhangetal.2009). 38 1 introduction recognizing these interesting applications, a number of uwb-based sensor network concepts have been developed both in the industrial and in the govern- ment/military domain. of particular importance are systems based on the uwb impulse radio ieee 802.15.4a standard, which via well-defined flexible phy and mac layer is suitable for a wide variety of applications. furthermore, it works together with the zigbee networking standard, the dominant technology in wsn systems. design-wise, among two options within the 802.15.4a standard, the uwb lr-wpan option is built to provide communications and high precision ranging (ranging is a process or method to determine the distance from one location or positiontoanotherlocationorposition)/locatingcapability(1meteraccuracyand better),highaggregatethroughput,andultra-lowpower,aswellasaddingscalability

ensure very robust perfor- manceunderharshmultipathandinterferenceconditions. 2022 concatenated forward error correction coding to provide flexible and robust performance. 2022 optional uwb pulse

thatconsistofnodeswithdifferentcapabilitiesandrequirements.anetworkhas at least one full-function device (ffd) and several reduced-function devices (rfds).ffds are typicallymore expensive (they area minority ofthe network devices); they are often configured to handle higher processing complexity. for ffds, higher energy consumption is not a real concern since they are usually connected to a permanent power supply. on the other hand, sensor nodes are usually rfds with extremely stringent limits on complexity and energy consumption. 2022 the uwb phy layer, which includes modulation, coding, and multiple-access schemes(mcm),hasbeendesignedinsuchawaythatitallowsbothffdsand rfds to achieve optimum performance, such as allowing the ffd devices to employ coherent reception (enhanced performance at the cost of energy con- sumption and complexity), while rfds use simple energy detectors (non-coherentreceivers)forreducedcurrentdrainanddesignsimplicity.further-

this means that the nodes can act as transmitters, receivers, or transceivers to route traffic to other nodes. ant is a good protocol for practical networks because of this inherent ability to support ad hoc interconnection of tens or hundreds of nodes. ant allows a system to spend mostofitstimeinanultra-low-powersleepmode,wakeupquickly,transmitforthe shortest possible time, and quickly return back to an ultra-low-power sleep mode. this implies that ant is one of the energy-efficient available technologies. while bluetooth is designed for rapid file transfer between devices in a pan, its average

manetsandmeshnetworks.careisalsoaccordedtothedifferentwsnstandards thatadapttohomeandindustryapplications. concernsthatwsnshavebeenunreliableanddifficulttousearelessening.but to put a wsn together, a potential user or developer has to be adept in multiple disciplines,hardware,embeddedsoftwareprogramming,rf,andenterpriseintegra- tion,whichcreatesagapbetweenapplicationconceptanddeployednetwork.what isconstantlyneeded isawaytoabstractthecomplexity ofsettingupandcommis- sioning a wsn from the ongoing management and data mining of the sensor data itself. as much as wsns are made easily accessible over conventional ip-based networks,theirpotentialuserbasewillbecomefarvasterandmorediverse. a key attribute of wsns, and the reason they represent the future of intelligent embedded devices, is their ability to be deployed in diverse and varied physical worldenvironments.withnocomputer-basedmapofsensorlocations,usersmaybe left alone to remember (or guess) where their sensors had been deployed. sensor networkapplications,thatbindthephysicaltothelogicalpositioning,allowusersto upload an existing floor plan, map or image into the wsn user interface, and then survey an individual sensor node

exercises 47 oncethenetworkisformedandthesensornodesstartcollectingdata.collected data need to be accessible, either in a database or directly to an application for display or analysis. this is where the wsns have taken experience from the enterprise it world. modern enterprise applications communicate and share infor- mationusingthewebservicesmodel,whichprovidesaconvenientandscalableway for wsns to pass collected data to an end-user application or remote database. sensor data can be accessed from a corporate it network using web services that

designing power-efficient mac protocols is one of the tech- niques that prolong the lifetime of the network. in addition to energy efficiency, latency and throughput are also important features for

data management in wireless sensor networks. in-network data processing techniques,fromsimplereportingtomorecomplicatedcollectivecommunications, such as data aggregation, broadcast, multicast, and gossip, are challenging. on the other hand, data collected by sensors can intrinsically be viewed as signals. by exploiting signalprocessing techniques, collective communications can be done in more energy-efficient ways. several work deal with data management (xu et al. 2009) investigate in-network query processing strategies for k nearest neighbor (knn) queries in location aware wireless sensor networks. also, brayne et al. (2008) propose an adaptive query processing mechanism to dynamically adjust query processing in wireless sensor networks. moreover, akcan and br nnimann (2007)developadistributed,weightedsamplingalgorithmtosamplesensingdatato reduceenergyconsumption.byexploringtheadaptivemodelselectionalgorithms, le borgne et al. (2007) derive an adaptive, lightweight, and online algorithm for predictionsensingdata. senseddataareoflimitedusageifitisnotaccompaniedbythecoordinatesofthe sensorpositionandatimestamp;thisisaprimarymotiveforclocksynchronization in wsns. data fusion is a prime function that depends also on clock synchroniza- tion. for instance, a vehicle going through acoustic sensors can be detected, throughout its path, by different sensor nodes at different moments. a fusion node receivingtherawinformationfromthesensornodescanrefineitbyestimatingthe speed and the direction of the sensed vehicle. for this application, among others, 2.6 applicationlayer 61 synchronized timestamps together with position information are essential. also, wsns are expected to have very small form factors and be cheap such that they can be deployed in very large numbers. once deployed, wsns are usually unattended, so battery replacement is impractical, but since they are typically expected to work for extended periods of time, there is no better way to conserve energy but to put the nodes to sleep and to wake up at the same time to be able to exchange information. clock synchronization in wsns is the subject of extensive work(elsonandr mer2003;sundararamanetal.2005;sunetal.2006;sommer andwattenhofer2009;wuetal.2011). positioning, knowledge of the position of the sensing nodes in a wsn is an essentialpartofmanysensornetworkoperationsandapplications.sensorsreporting monitoreddataneedtoalsoreportthelocationwheretheinformationissensed,and hence, sensors need

distance estimations of a sensor to several reference points, or replay beacons from one part of the network to some distant part of the network, thus providing false localization information. hence, there is a need to ensure that the location estimation is performed in a robust way, even in the presence of attacks. furthermore, adversaries can compromise the untethered sensor devices and force them to report a false location to the data collection points. therefore, a secure positioning system must have a mechanism toverifythelocationclaimofanysensor.positioninginwsnisatopicofextensive

administrators interact with wsns using sensor management protocol (smp).unlikemanyothernetworks,wsnsconsistofnodesthatdonothaveglobal ids, and they are usually infra-structureless. therefore, smp

energy constraints of battery-powered sensor nodes necessitate energy- efficient communication protocols in order to fulfill the application objectives of wireless sensor networks (wsns). it is much more resource-efficient, according to some research, to have a unified scheme which melts common protocol layer functionalities into a cross-layer module for resource-constrained sensor nodes. a unifiedcross-layercommunicationprotocol,forefficientandreliableeventcommu- nication, considers the effects on wsns of replacing transport, routing, medium

usage is a very important concern in a wsn, and there has been significant research focus that revolves around harvesting and energy conservation by minimizing energy con- sumption.whenasensornodeisdepletedofenergy,itwillfadeoutanddisengage from the network, which may significantly impact the performance of the applica- tion. sensor network lifetime depends on the number of active nodes and network connectivity, so energy must be used efficiently in order to maximize the network lifetime. energy harvesting involves nodes replenishing their energy from an energy source (gilbert and balouchi 2008; galperti and alippi 2008; seah et al. 2009; vullersetal.2010).potentialenergysourcesincludesolarcells(handeetal.2007), vibration(leiandyuan2008),fuelcells,acousticnoise,andamobilesuppliersuch asa robot toreplenish energy. the robotscharge themselveswith energy andthen deliverenergytothenodes. energy conservation in a wsn maximizes network lifetime and is addressed through efficient reliable wireless communication, smart sensor placement to achieve adequate coverage, security and efficient storage management, and data aggregation and data compression. such approaches satisfy both the energy con- straint and provide qos. for reliable communication, services such as congestion control, active buffer monitoring, acknowledgments, and packet-loss recovery are necessary to guarantee packet delivery. communication strength depends on the placement of sensor nodes. sparse sensor placement may result in long-range transmission and higher energy usage, while dense sensor placement may result in short-range transmission and less energy consumption. coverage is interrelated to sensor placement. the total number of sensors in the network and their placement determine the degree of network coverage. depending on the application, a higher degreeofcoveragemayberequiredtoincreasetheaccuracyofthesenseddata. one for

communication safe against external denial-of-service (dos) attacks and intrusion. wsns have special characteristics that enable new ways of security attacks. passive attacks are carried out by eavesdropping on transmissions, includingtrafficanalysisordisclosureofmessagecontents.activeattacksconsist ofmodification,fabrication,and interruption, whichinwsn cases mayinclude nodecapturing,routingattacks,orflooding. 2022 large-scale deployment and ad hoc architecture. most wsns contain a large number of sensor nodes (hundreds to thousands or even more), which might be spreadrandomlyoverthedeploymentfield.moreover,thelackofpredetermined networkinfrastructurenecessitatesthewsnstoestablishconnectionsandmain- tainnetworkconnectivityautonomously. 2022 integration with internet and other networks. it is of prime importance for the commercialdevelopmentofwsnstoprovideservicesthatallowthequeryingof the network to retrieve useful information from anywhere and at any time. for this reason, wsns should be remotely accessible from the internet and, hence, need to be integrated with the internet protocol (ip) architecture, either through gateways or thorough ip connectivity (montenegro et al. 2007; akyildiz et al. 2007). 3.1.2 design objectives of wsns the existing and potential applications of wsns span a very wide range of applications. to deal with the technical challenges and meet the diverse wsn application requirements, specially industrial, and by resemblances military and environmental applications, several design goals need to be adopted (gungor and hancke2009): 2022 low-cost and small sensor nodes. compact and low-cost sensor devices are essential to accomplish large-scale deployments of wsns. the system owner should consider the cost of ownership (packaging requirements, modifications, maintainability,etc.),implementationcosts,replacementandlogisticscosts,and trainingandservicingcostsaswellastheperunitcosts(howittetal.2006). 2022 scalable architectures and efficient protocols. wsns support heterogeneous applicationswithdifferentrequirements,especiallyinindustryandenvironment. it is necessary to develop flexible and scalable architectures that can accommo- datetherequirementsofalltheseapplicationsinthesameinfrastructure.modular and hierarchical systems can enhance the system flexibility, robustness, and reliability. in addition, interoperability with existing legacy solutions, such as fieldbus(thomesse2005)andethernet-basedsystems,isrequired. 70 3 wsnsapplications 2022 datafusionandlocalizedprocessing.insteadofsendingtherawdatatothesink node directly, sensor nodes can locally filter the sensed database and transmit only the processed data, which is in-network processing. thus, only necessary information is transported to the end user and communication overhead can be significantlyreduced. 2022 resource-efficientdesign.inwsns,energyefficiencyisimportanttomaximize thenetworklifetimewhileprovidingtheqosrequiredbytheapplication.energy saving can be accomplished in every component of the network by integrating network functionalities with energy-efficient protocols, e.g., energy-aware routingonnetworklayer,andenergy-savingmodeonmaclayer. 2022 self-configuration and self-organization. in wsns, the dynamic topologies caused by node failure/mobility/ temporary power-down and large-scale node deployments necessitate self-organizing architectures and protocols. note that, with the use of self-configurable wsns, new sensor nodes can be added to replacefailed sensor nodesinthedeploymentfield,andexisting nodescanalso be removed from the system without affecting the general objective of the application. 2022 adaptive network operation. the adaptability of wsns is extremely crucial, sinceitenablesenduserstocopewithdynamic/varyingwirelesschannelcondi- tionsinmilitary,industrial,environmentalapplications,andwithnewconnectiv- ity requirements driven by new processes. to balance the trade-offs among resources, accuracy, latency, and time synchronization requirements, adaptive signalprocessingalgorithmsandcommunicationprotocolsareneeded. 2022 time synchronization. inwsns,largenumbersofsensor nodesneedtocollab- orate to perform the sensing task, and the collected data are usually delay- sensitive (howitt et al. 2006; akyildiz et al. 2007). thus, time synchronization is one of the key design goals for communication protocol design to meet the deadlines of the application. however, due to resource and size limitations and lackofafixedinfrastructure,aswellasthedynamictopologiesinwsns,existing timesynchronizationstrategiesdesignedforothertraditionalwiredandwireless networksmaynotbeappropriateforwsns.adaptiveandscalabletimesynchro- nizationprotocolsarerequiredforwsns. 2022

programming/retaskingdataforsensoroperation,command,andqueriesshould bereliablydeliveredtothetargetsensornodestoensuretheproperfunctioningof wsns. however, for many wsn applications, the sensed data are exchanged overtime-varying anderror-prone wireless medium. thus, data verification and correction on each communication layer and self-recovery procedures are extremelycriticaltoprovideaccurateresultstotheenduser. 2022 application-specific design. in wsns, there exists no one-size-fits-all solution; instead,thealternativedesignsandtechniquesshouldbedevelopedbasedonthe application-specificqosrequirementsandconstraints. 2022 secure design. when designing the security mechanisms for wsns, both low-level (key establishment and trust control, secrecy and authentication, 3.2 militaryapplications 71 privacy, robustness to communication denial of service (dos), secure routing, resiliencetonodecapture),andhigh-level(securegroupmanagement,intrusion detection, secure data aggregation) security primitives should be addressed (perrig et al. 2004). in addition, because of resource limitations in wsns, the overheadassociatedwithsecurityprotocolsshouldbebalancedagainstotherqos performance requirements. it is very challenging to meet all aforementioned design goals simultaneously. fortunately, most wsn designs have different requirements and priorities on design objectives. therefore, the network designers and application developers should balance the trade-offs among the differentparameterswhendesigningprotocolsandarchitecturesforwsns. inthesectionstocome,severalapplicationsofwsnsarepresented.applications are categorized into military, industrial,

3.2.1 countersniper system for urban warfare in (l deczi et al. 2005), an ad hoc wsn-based system is presented; it detects and accurately locates shooters even in urban environments. the presented

widelyusedcomponent-basedarchitecturetargetingwirelesssensornetworkappli- cations. open interfaces at the software and hardware levels made it possible to integrate specialized smart sensor elements and supporting middleware services. each mica2 mote is furnished with an atmega 128 l 8-bit microcontroller with 128 bytes instruction memory (atmel 2011a), 4 kbytes data memory and typical embedded peripherals built-in. the onboard radio transceiver operates in the 433 mhz ism band and has a maximum transfer rate of 38.4 kbits/sec with the maximumrangeofabout300feet(moogcrossbow2013). real-time detection, classification, and correlation of acoustic events require processing power and buffer sizes not present in standard microcontroller-based embeddeddevices.toovercometheselimitations,application-specificsensorboards have been designed and built at vanderbilt university. the different architectures reflectthecurrentdilemmafacedbymanysignalprocessingengineers: 2022 thefirstversionofthesensorboard(fig.3.2)utilizesaxilinxxc2s100fpga chip(xilinx2008)withthreeindependentanalogchannelsexploitingtheinher- ent parallelism of the hardware. the algorithms implemented in vhdl are focusing on precise time domain analysis of acoustic signals captured at high sample rates (one million sample/sec). hardware and software interfaces (i2c bus,interrupts,leddisplay,andseriala/d)areimplementedascustomintellec- tual property core (ip cores) in the same gate array. while this approach offers fig.3.2 thefpga-basedacousticsensorboard 3.2 militaryapplications 75 fig.3.3 thedsp-basedacousticsensorboard veryappealingfeatures,thatis,highaccuracy(notethatonboardangleofarrival estimate is possible), high speed (though not fully utilized for audio purposes), and efficient resource utilization, the size of the field-programmable gate array (fpga) component severely constrains the complexity of the applicable algo- rithms. suboptimal power consumption of the processing unit and the lack of effective power management modes are among the handicaps of the sensor networkdomain. 2022 to overcome these limitations, another sensorboard has been developed, where customized analog signal paths and an energy-efficient, powerful digital signal processor(dsp)make theunituniquelysuitableforpower-constrained applica- tions. at the heart of the second platform (fig. 3.3) is a low-power fixed-point adsp-218x(analogdevices1998)digitalsignalprocessorrunningat50mhz. its internal program (48 kbyte) and data (56 kbyte) memory buffers with

the muzzle blast and shockwave detectors are implemented in vhdl on the fpga of the first-generation sensorboard and in c on the dsp board. the toa data from either board are sent through the

of the signal processing algorithm is shown in fig. 3.5. the incoming raw acoustic signal is compressed using zero-crossing (zc) coding. the codedsignalsareusedtodetectpossibleoccurrencesofshockwaveandmuzzleblast patterns by the shockwave detection (swd) and muzzle blast detection (mbd) blocks, respectively. although the operation of the two detection blocks is mainly independent, the swd block can provide information (time of arrival of the detected shockwave) for the mbd block to facilitate the detection of a muzzle blast after a shockwave. both blocks measure the toa of the detected acoustic event using the onboard clock and then notify the mote. the mica2 mote reads the measurement data (toa and optionally signal characteristics) and performs time synchronization between its own clock and that of the acoustic board. the measurement data are then propagated back to the basestation using middleware services of the sensor network. thesignaldetectionalgorithmprovedtobequiterobust.itrecognized100%of thetrainingeventsandmorethan90%oftheotherrecordedshotevents.itistobe noted that, in reality, a shot may be

board utilizes a powerful xilinx xc3s1000 fpga chip (xilinx 2013) with variousstandardperipheralipcores,multiplesoftprocessorcores,andcustomlogic for the acoustic detectors (fig. 3.6). the onboard flash (4 mbyte) and the pseudostatic random access memory (psram) (8 mbyte) modules allow storing raw samples of several acoustic events, which can be used to build libraries of various acoustic

with controllable gain (30 60 db), and a 12-bit serial adc ad7476 (analog devices 2013), reside on separate tiny boards which are connected to the main sensorboard with ribbon cables. this partitioning enables the use of truly different audio channels (e.g., slower sampling frequency, different gain or dynamic range) and also results in lessnoisymeasurementsbyavoidinglonganalogsignalpaths. the sensor platform offers a rich set of interfaces and can be integrated with existing systems in diverse ways.anrs232 port and a bluetooth

channels.the ad hoc internode communication,timesynchroniza- tion, and data sharing are the responsibilities of a microcontroller-based radio module. 3.2.2.3 detectionalgorithm there are several characteristics of acoustic shockwaves and muzzle blasts, which distinguish their detection and signal processing algorithms from regular audio applications. both events are transient by their nature

follows the shockwave signal and because of potential automatic weapon bursts, it is extremely important to settle the audio channels and the detection logic as soon as possible after an event. also,

sensor fusion, however, could incorporate wind speed into its calculations. 2022 silencers reduce the muzzle blast energy, and hence, the effective range the system can detect it at. however, silencers do not effect the shockwave and the system would still detect the trajectory and caliber accurately. the range and weapon type could not be estimated without muzzle blast detections.

common needs, such as data collection. 3.3.1.1.1 energyusageevaluation it is estimated by the department of energy (doe) that motor-driven systems use overtwo-thirdofthetotalelectricenergyconsumedbyindustryintheunitedstates. in industry, motors below 200 hp. make up 98% of the motors in service and consume 85% of the energy used. on average, these motors operate at no more than 60% of their rated load because of oversized installations or underloaded conditions and thus at reduced efficiency which results in wasted energy. as the global energy shortage and the greenhouse effect worsen, the improvement of energy usage in industry is drawing more attention. obviously, to improve energy efficiency, an evaluation of the energy usage condition of the industrial plant is required. amongalltheenergyusageevaluationfunctions,motorefficiencyestimationis themostimportant.intheliterature,manymotorefficiencyestimationmethodshave been proposed

considering the advances in sensorless speed estimation and in-service stator resistance estimation techniques. three can- didate methods for non-intrusive efficiency estimation are modified for in-service motor testing. the non-intrusive characteristic of these methods enables efficiency evaluationwithawsn. 3.3.1.1.2 conditionmonitoring motor condition monitoring gives the health condition of running electric motors and avoids economical losses resulting from unexpected motor failures. sharing many common requirements with energy usage evaluation in terms of data collec- tion,

3.3.1.1.3 additionalrequirements generally, the measurements needed for each efficiency estimation and condition monitoring method are different, but essentially all require the input line voltages and the line currents. some methods require the nameplate data (rated voltage, current, horsepower, speed, etc.), stator resistance, rs, or rotor speed,  . among r these, the measurements or estimates of stator resistance and speed have for years been regarded as stumbling blocks. however, research has made great progress in the area of stator resistance and speed estimation (lu et al. 2006). most of these estimators utilize the terminal voltages and currents, which are available in the energyevaluationandconditionmonitoringsystem. wsns target primarily the very low-cost and ultra-low-power consumption applications, with data throughput and reliability as secondary considerations. fueled by the need to enable inexpensive wsns for monitoring and control of non-criticalfunctionsintheresidential,commercial,andindustrialapplications,the concept of a standardized low-rate wireless personal area networks (lr-wpans) has emerged (guti rrez et al. 2004). in october 2003, the lr-wpans standard finally became the ieee 802.15.4 standard (callaway et al. 2002). the unique characteristicsoftheieeestd.802.15.4/lr-wpanssuchastheflexibility,inherent

clustered network topology is supportedinnetworksthatrequireenergyefficiency,sincetransmittingdatathrough relays consumes less energy than routing directly to the sink (heinzelman et al. 2002). in (ma and aylor 2004), a dynamic clustering method adapts the network parameters. in (heinzelman et al. 2002) and (younis and fahmy 2004), a cluster header is selected based on the residual energy levels for clustered environments. however,theperiodic selection ofclusteringmaynotbeenergy-efficientanddoes notensuretheflexibilityofthenetworktoatime-varyingwirelesschannelenviron- ment. a simpler geographic clustering is instead used in breath. nodes in the 3.3 industrialapplications 101 forwarding region send short beacon messages when they are available to receive datapackets.beaconmessagescarryinformationrelatedtothecontrolparametersof the protocol. when a node receives a beacon message with theupdated number of clusters h-1, then the node adapts to its cluster based on a rough knowledge of its location. in the two coming sections, the protocol stack and state machine of breath are described. 3.3.2.3 thebreathprotocolstack breath uses a randomized routing, a csma/ca mechanism at the mac, radio power control at the physical layer, and sleeping disciplines. in many industrial environments,thewirelessconditionsvaryheavilybecauseofmovingmetalobsta- clesandradiodisturbances.insuchsituations,routingschemesthatusefixedrouting tablescannotprovidetheflexibilitynecessaryformobileequipment,physicaldesign limitations, and reconfiguration characteristic of an industrial control application. fixed routing is inefficient in wsns due to the cost of building and maintaining routing tables. to overcome this limitation, routing through a random sequence of hopshasbeenintroducedin(zorziandrao2003).thebreathprotocolisbuiltonan optimized random routing, where next-hop route is efficiently selected at random, nodes route data packets to next-hop nodes randomly selected in a forwarding region. randomized routing allows reducing overhead because no node coordina- tion or routing state needs to be maintained by the network; it also considerably increasesrobustnesstonodefailures. the mac of breath is based on a csma/ca mechanism similar to the ieee 802.15.4. both data packets and beacon packets are transmitted using the same mac.specifically,thecsma/cachecksthechannelactivitybyperformingclear channel assessment (cca) before the transmission can commence. each node maintains a variable nb for each transmission attempt,

a backoff of random (0, w-1) backoff units, i.e., a random number of backoffs uniformly distributed over 0,1,..., w-1. if the cca fails, i.e., the channel is busy, nb is increased by one and the

for under-rubble environments (bozkurtetal.2016).afteradisaster,thesurvivalofvictimstrappedunder-rubble mostly depends on how quickly they are found, rescued, and treated. first responders use search-and-rescue techniques such as canines, listening devices, and radars, which search the rubble s near-surface regions. however, complemen- tary techniques are needed to penetrate the smaller gaps and cavities deep in the rubble.distributed systems areindisputably superiorfor tasks suchas exploration, mapping, and large-area sensing. recent achievements in swarm robotics, a new multirobot coordination-system approach, have been inspired thru observations of emergent collective behaviors among insects. in swarm robotics, multiple smaller-

disadvantages are their range, especially under-rubble, and their need for additionalhardware,whichentailsadditionalweightandpowerconsumption. fortunately, the speakers and microphones can be reused for detecting and communicatingwithsurvivors. devising a localization method that can provide the biobots  location given the range measurements is a tricky challenge. although several research have been published on localization in wsns, their approaches are generally not appropriate for disaster conditions. to begin with, any approach relying on fingerprinting is excluded, because prior calibration is impossible in most disaster scenarios. also, centralized approaches are unsuitable, because the network might be loosely connected or even disconnected at times, while the biobots  mobility implies that the localization process must be repeated periodically. furthermore, the extremely limited resources on the biobots reveal that the approaches relying on significant amountsofcommunicationorcomputationarealsounsuitable,thusarisestheneed for fully distributed, low-computation, localization approaches that are resilient to range measurement errors. errors in range

3.5.1.1 powerconsumption oneofthemainissuesaboutthebanisthepowerconsumption,sincechangingthe batteries is a burdensome task. because of this, development of energy-efficient mac protocols and energy-efficient sensor devices is critical (omeni et al. 2008). technologies like bluetooth and wi-fi fail to provide support for energy-efficient systems since they can only offer one- or two-week runtime on a coin like small battery(bhatiaetal.2007).theproperuseofthewirelesscommunicationchannels 3.5 healthcareapplications 149

sensors16(muratamanufacturingco.2012;adafruitlearningtechnologies2014), as in (lee et al. 2007), a simple yetefficient remote monitoring application can be developed. 3.5.1.2 outputtransmissionpowerofthesensornodes the output power must be kept minimal for health issues, which may lead to coverage and communication problems. the study presented in (ren and meng 2006)

3.5.1.5 real-timeavailabilityandreliablecommunications the real-time availability and reliable communications of the system is a further major issuesince thedata gatheredby such system may be critical. in(nyan etal. 2008) there is a design of a wearable fall detection system that can detect the falls with an average lead time of 700 msec before the incident occurs. a framework proposal for high levels of reliability and low delays is available in (varshney 2008a). the performance results show that reliable message delivery and low monitoring delays can be achieved by using multicast or broadcast-based routing schemesinanadhocnetwork. 3.5.1.6 multihopdesign additionally,designing multihopsystemsareofgreatimportance.asin(laietal. 2009), continuous monitoring of the patients ecg, without range limit due to the extendedcommunicationcoveragebymultihopwirelessconnectivity,isoneofthe basicneedsforsuchcriticalapplications. 3.5.1.7 security

medical devices can be controlled, and contextawarenesswithauser-friendlyinterfaceisprovidedtothepatient. 3.5.2.3 efficientlocatingalgorithms efficient algorithms for locating rfid-tagged objects

flexibly set the resolutions in any situation. in their experi- ments, the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) of ecg can be promoted from 25 to 73 db whenextraordinaryecgsignaloccurs. 3.5.2.5 self-organizationbetweennodes the self-organization between the nodes is essential. in mitag system (gao et al. 2008), the data collected from a self-organizing wireless network of sensors that

before establishing encryption, the security policies must be addressed in the first place. moreover, for multimodal systemssuchasrfidenhancedpervasivehealthcaresystems,thesecurityissuesfor every

should be reliable. reliability issues are classified into three main categories:reliabledatameasurement,reliabledatacommunication,andreliabledata analysis (lee et al. 2008). although the reliable data measurement and communi- cation issues belong to the ban and pan subsystems, they are essential for the reliable data analysis at the application layer. a typical architecture handles data cleaning, data fusion, and context and knowledge generation for reliable data analysis. data analysis is critical for pervasive healthcare systems since the infer- ences

distribution of resources and facilitates the inclusion of new functionalities in highly dynamic environments. wsns provide an 160 3 wsnsapplications infrastructure capable of supporting the

the radio band known as industrial, scientific, and medical (ism), especially in the 868 mhz band in europe, the 915 mhz in the u.s.a., and the 2.4 ghz in almost all over the world (zigbee alliance 2013). the underlying ieee 802.15.4 standard is designed to work with low-power and limited computational resources nodes (ieee 2013a, b). zigbee incorporates additional network, application, and security layers over the 802.15.4 standard; it allows up to 65,534 nodes connected in a star, tree, or mesh topology network (baronti et al. 2007). bluetooth is another standard to deploy wsns; it allowsmultiplewpanandwbanapplicationsforinterconnectingmobilephones, earphones, personal computers, printers, etc. bluetooth also operates in the ism 2.4ghzband;itcreatesstartopologynetworksofuptoeightdevicesinwhichone of them acts as master and the rest as slaves. several bluetooth networks can be

difficultyforintegratingdevicesfromdifferenttechnologiesinasinglenetwork(lei et al. 2006). in addition, the lack of a common architecture may lead to additional costs due to the necessity of deploying nontransparent interconnection elements betweennetworks.moreover,thedevelopedelements(e.g.,devices)aretoodepen- dentontheapplicationtowhichtheybelong,hencecomplicatingtheirreutilization. someapproachesattempttointegratedevicesbyimplementingmiddlewarelayersas reduced versions of virtual machines (e.g., squawk java virtual machine); they

scenarios. the sylph platform integrates an soa approach for facilitating the distribution and management of resources (i.e., services) into heterogeneous wsns. there are several attempts to

integrates an soa approach over wsns for building systems based on the ami paradigm. as previ- ously stated, the soa approach has been chosen because such architectures are asynchronous and non-dependent on context (i.e., previous states of the system, whichmustnotbeconfusedwithcontext-awareenvironments).thus,devicesdonot continuously spend processing time and are free to do other tasks, which saves energy. sylph can be executed over multiple wireless devices independently of their microcontrollerortheprogramminglanguagetheyuse;beingdistributed,theappli-

to a node from a different technology. in this case, both wsns are interconnected by means of a set of intermediate gateways connected to several wirelessinterfacessimultaneously. sylphorganizationisbasedonastackoflayers.figure3.32showsthedifferent layers added over the application layer of each wsn stack. the sylph message layer (sml) offers to the upper layers the possibility of sending asynchronous messages between two wireless devices through the sylph services protocol (ssp). ssp is the internetworking protocol of the sylph platform, and it has

connected to the remote healthcare telemonitoring center via the internet. alerts can be forwarded from the patient s homes to the caregivers in the remote center, allowing communication with patients

additional processor (microcontrollers, dsps, fpgas, etc.) and memory resources before relaying the processed data to the wireless mote for wireless communication. yet, the additional processor and memory resources require more energy consumption and cost, which prompts a trade-off between energy consumption and cost against computational power and

second (fps) in vga, cif, and lower resolutions, and 15 fps in sxga. the ov9655 is designed to perform well in low-light conditions. the typical active power consumption is 90 mw (15 fps @sxga) and

processing, and the flash is for storing code. 64 mbyte of sdram is more than sufficient for storing two frames at 1.3 megapixel resolution (3 bytes/ pixel   1.3 megapixel   2 frames = 8 mbyte), the

speed/bandwidth, capacity, power consumption,cost,physicalsize,andavailability. 204 3 wsnsapplications the choices for non-volatile memory were nand and nor flash. nand has lower cost-per-bit and higher density but slower random access, and nor has the capability to execute code directly out of the non-volatile memory on boot up (execution-in-place, xip). nor flash was chosen not only because it supported xip, but also because nand flash is not natively supported by the pxa270 processor. thechoicesforvolatilememoryweremobilesdramandpseudosram,both ofwhichconsumeverylittlepower.low-powerconsumptionisanimportantfactor when choosing memory because it has been demonstrated that the memory in handsets demands up to 20 percent of the total power budget, equal to the power demands of the application processor. mobile sdram was chosen because of its significantlyhigherdensityandspeed. 2022 microphone. in order to run high-bandwidth, multimodal sensing algorithms fusingaudioandvideosensoroutputs,itwasimportanttoincludeamicrophone on the camera daughter board rather than using a microphone attached to the tmote sky wireless mote. this simplified the operation of the entire system by dedicatingthecommunicationbetweenthetmoteskyandthecameradaughter board to data that needed to be transmitted over the wireless network. the microphone on the board is connected to the wolfson wm8950 mono audio adc (wolfson microelectronics 2011), which was designed for portable appli- cations. the wm8950 features high-quality audio (at sample rates

more computing power and tighter integration of physical components while still consuming relatively little power. furthermore, the mote easily integrates with existing low-bandwidth sensor net- works because it can communicate over the ieee 802.15.4 protocol with other sensor network platforms. citric was tested on three applications, image com- pression,targettracking,andcameralocalization. 3.7

ahinandwinfield2008)and(gaziandpassino2011).nonetheless, most of the research works on collaborative robotics, such as swarming, have remained mostly either theoretical or incomplete practical systems lacking some important pieces of the puzzle such as realistic communication channel modeling 3.8 roboticwsns(rwsns) 217 andefficientnetworkprotocolsforinteractionamongtherobots.theterm realistic communicationchannelmodel referstoawirelesschannelmodelthataccountsfor mostofthewell-knowndynamicsofastandardwirelesschannelsuchaspathloss, fading,andshadowing(rappaport2002). on the other hand, the field of wireless networks, more specifically, wsns and wireless ad hoc networks, has been explored extensively by communication and network researchers, where the nodes are considered static or mobile. with the availabilityofcheapeasilyprogrammablerobots,researcheshavestartedtoexplore theadvantagesandopportunitiesgrantedbythecontrolledmobilityinthecontextof wireless networks. nonetheless, the mobility models used by the network researchers remained simple, impractical, and not very pertinent to robotic motion controluntillastdecade(ghoshetal.2019). overthelastdecade,ahandfulofresearchersnoticedthesignificantdisconnec- tion between the robotics and the wireless network research communities and its bottleneck effects in the full-fledged development of a network of collaborative robots. consequently, incorporating wireless network technologies in robotics and viceversaopenedupawholenewfieldofresearchattheintersectionofroboticsand wirelessnetworks.thisnewresearchdomainiscalledbymanydifferentnamessuch as  wireless robotics networks,   wireless automated networks,   networked robots, and roboticwirelesssensornetworks(rwsns) (ghoshetal.2019). to get acquainted with the field of rwsn, some core questions are raised and answered.whatisarwsn?whatkindofresearchworksareclassifiedasrwsn related?whatarethesystemcomponentsandalgorithmsrequiredforrwsns? 3.8.2.1 whatisarwsn? rwsn is defined as a wireless network that includes a set of robotic nodes with controlledmobilityandasetofnodesequippedwithsensors,whereasallnodeshave wireless communication capabilities (ghosh et al. 2019). ideally, as clarified in fig. 3.57, each node in a robotic sensor network should have controlled mobility, asetofsensors,andwirelesscommunicationcapabilities.suchnodesarereferredto as  robotic wireless sensors (rws).  nonetheless, a rwsn can also have some nodes with just sensing and wireless communication capabilities but without con- trolled mobility. following traditional terminology, such nodes are referred to as  wireless sensors.  moreover, a rwsn typically fulfills or guarantees certain communication performance requirements imposed by the application contexts suchasminimumachievablebiterrorrate(ber)ineverylinkofthenetwork. 3.8.2.2 whatkindofresearchworksarerwsnrelated? the existing research works related to rwsn can be subdivided into two broader genres(ghoshetal.2019): 218 3 wsnsapplications wireless communication module robot sensor fig.3.57 roboticwirelesssensors.(ghoshetal.2019) 2022 the first genre focuses on generic multirobot sensing systems with realistic communication channels, i.e., they include the effects of fading, shadowing, etc., between the robots. these are mostly works in the robotics literature on multirobot systems with practical wireless communication and networking

to reduce end-to-end delay of packets,andmultiobjectivemotioncontrolandoptimization. 2022 the second genre of works focuses on the application of rws to create and support a temporary communication backbone between a set of communicating entities.inthesecontexts,theterms roboticrouter and roboticwirelesssensor  areusedsynonymously,toputemphasisonthecommunicationandroutinggoals.

rws in setting up a temporary communication backbone. while sensing is still involved for the robotic router placement optimization and adaptation, the main purpose of the

fig.3.59 roboticroutersforcommunicationinthepresenceofobstacles.(ghoshetal.2019) 3.8.2.3 whatarethesystemcomponentsandalgorithmsrequired forrwsns? several research problems are needed for rwsns; these topics are individual researchproblemsbythemselvesandrequireseparateattentions(ghoshetal.2019): 2022 rssi models, measurements, and rf mapping. in a rwsn, it is important to estimateandmonitorthequalityofthecommunicationlinksbetweenthenodes, in terms of ber, sinr, etc., in order to satisfy the communication-related requirements. noticeably, rf-based communication is the standard mode of communication in rwsn. for practicality, these estimations must be either partlyorfullybasedononlinerfsensingsuchastemporalrssimeasurements

whilethebasestationinwsnscanhavecontinuouspowersupply,asensornode has limited resources in terms of processing capability and memory, restricted battery backup along with unpredictable harvesting capabilities that determine its longevity and whole network lifetime. a sensor node lifetime is constrained by backup available at a time, amount of computation, as well as communication it carries out depending on the distance with communicating nodes. once power backup depletes below a threshold, the node gets disconnected. therefore, energy management and conservation techniques present a major research challenge for wsns(fahmy2020). 4.2 wsnsenergyandlifetimeterminology,models,andmetrics 247 communication sensors cpu send receive idle sleep )wm(rewop 20 15 10 5 0 fig.4.1 energyconsumptiondistributionofasensornode(estrin2002) asexhibitedinfig.4.1,thecommunicationrequiredfromatypicalsensornode is the major power consumer; its wireless communication module has four states: typically, send, receive, idle, and sleep. transmitting signals, i.e., sending and receiving, take about two thirds of its total energy consumption, while the number of transmitted data packets of a node depends to a great extent on the routing strategy. an efficient routing protocol can balance the energy consumption levels among wsn nodes; given the same hardware conditions, it can help prolong the lifetime of a wsn, as well as improve the quality of data transmission. however, traditional routing protocols tend to focus on how to make the data packets reach fastesttheirdestinationalongtheshortesttransmissionpath.thismaynotbethebest fromtheviewpointofwsnlifetimeowingtotheirenergy-constrainedsensornodes. furthermore, due to the minimal energy consumption at the sleep and idle states, consideration is mostly accorded to the energy consumption of the sending and receivingstatesonly. a model describing the energy consumption of wireless sensor nodes is devel- opedin(zhouetal.2011). 4.2 wsns energy and lifetime terminology, models, and metrics this section is concerned with introducing the wsn energy and lifetime terminol- ogy and the energy

consumption becomes non-balanced and the lifetime of the whole network gets seriously affected. therefore, a combination of the shortest path and the extension of the network lifetime is most suitable for use in wsns. moreover, the lifetime of a nodeiseffectivelydeterminedbyitsbatterylife;themainbatterydrainageisdue totransmittingandreceivingdataamongnodes. thus,themainpurposeforthedesignofenergy-efficientandenergy-balanced routing protocols for wsns is to extend the network lifetime, which in turn preserves the network functionality. the network

residual energy (re). the lifetime of a sensor node is usually measured by its energy level after a given wsn data transmission round. the energy level in a node after each data transmission phase is referred to as its residual energy. given that the energy of a node at the initial deployment is defined as e , and the energy consumed by the node after a particular data in transmission round is e, the residual energy of the node can be defined as r (ogundileandalfa2017): xr e =e - e  4:1  re in r r=0 wheree =e forr=0,risthecurrentround,andristhemaximumnumber re in ofrounds. 4.2

avoid untimely network partitioning, most clustering-based routing protocols consider e as an essential decision metric in the routing re algorithms. 2022 average networkenergy

andenergy-balancedroutingprotocolsforwsns(kimetal.2010;caponeetal. 2010). the hop-count is defined as the number of relay nodes traversed by a packet from the source to the destination node. it is desirable to minimize the hop-count during the data transmission phase in order to extend as possible the lifetime of wsns. there should be a compromise between reducing the hop-count and maximizing the lifetime of wsns. by reducing the hop-count from the source node to the destination, some relay nodes are compelled to convey a large amount of data, hence depleting their energy. consequently, the hop-count is a decision metric when designing an energy-balanced routing protocolforwsns. thesemetricsareusedwithmoredetailswhenpresentingtheenergyandlifetime

have been some protocols that use flooding as part of their routing mechanism (ma et al. 2006). however, flooding consumes much energy, since for each data packet, all nodes that are in the broadcast domain will receive packetsthattheywillforwardtotheirneighbors.thus,alargeamountofpoweris requiredcausingaprohibitivelyshortwsnlifetime. 2022 gossiping and broadcasting are two situations of information dissemination related to a group of individuals connected by means of a communication network (hedetniemi et al. 1988). in gossiping, every person in the network

implosion problem by just having one copy of a message at any node, it takes long to propagate the messagetoallnodesinthewsn. 2022 rumor routing (rr). it is a compromise between flooding queries and flooding eventnotifications(braginskyandestrin2002).themainideaofthisprotocolis to create paths that lead to each event (fig. 4.9), unlike event flooding which creates a network-wide gradient field.

advantage of proactive (table-driven)routingprotocols,sincefasterroutingdecisionsandconsequentlyless delay in route setup process can be made (layuan et al. 2007). on the other hand, this significant advantage requires periodic routing updates of the routing tables, which costs higher signaling traffic than in the reactive (on-demand) routing pro- tocols. consequently, sensor nodes spend more energy for their periodic update 4.7 energy-efficientroutingprotocols 269 table4.3 proactiveandreactiveroutingprotocolscompared(pantazisetal.2013) proactive reactive protocols protocols

with single-path routing protocols. some of these protocols are routing on-demand acyclic multipath (roam) (raju and garcia-luna-aceves 1999), gradient broad-

thethroughputandaverageresponsetime.inaconnection-orientedcommunication, qosroutingisusuallyperformedthroughresourcesreservationthatmeetstheqos requirements for each individual connection. while many mechanisms have been proposed for qos routing in real-time multimedia wired networks, they cannot be typically applied to wsns due to the limited sensor nodes resources, such as processing, storage, bandwidth, and energy. among these qos-based routing pro- tocols for wsns, there are sequential assignment routing (sar) (sohrabi et al. 2000), speed (he et al. 2003), multipath and multi-speed (mmspeed) (felembanetal.2006),energy-efficient,andqosawaremultipathrouting(eqsr) protocol(ben-othmanandyahya2010). energy-efficient routing techniques for multimedia wsns with qos assurances are

energy-efficient and energy-balanced routing protocolforwsnsinvolvesseveraldecisionmetrics(sects.4.2.1and4.2.2).there should be a trade-off in setting these decision metrics. energy-balanced routing protocols for wsns must extend the network lifetime to a duration that maintains full network functionality as long as possible. these protocols also consider other design objectives, specifically, scalability, reliability, and accuracy (iqbal et al. 2015). 4.8.1 multihop communication differentroutingprotocolshavebeendevelopedusingthemultihopcommunication

conceptofmultihopcommunicationisadoptedtodevelopdifferentenergy-efficient and energy-balanced routing protocols for wsns. the main goal is to reduce the distance when transmitting the sensed information from the source node to the destination. the transmission distance plays a vital role in either reducing or increasing the energy dissipated by the wsn nodes. nonetheless, solving the distance issue through using the concept of multihop communication does not necessarily guarantee an optimal use of the limited battery energy in the wsn, as clarified in sect. 4.5. to resolve the distance concern associated with wsns, the multihopcommunicationtechniqueraisesotherdesignmatterssuchasselectingthe route with optimal hop-count to the basestation and/or the route to the basestation

therefore,severalmultihoptechniquesareproposedtotackletheseglitches,with the ultimate goal of conserving energy in wsns. these multihop techniques are classified into two main categories: namely, multihop clustering techniques and load-balancedtreetechniquesasdetailedinsects.4.8.1.1and4.8.1.2,respectively. 4.8.1.1 multihopclusteringtechniques over couple of decades, clustering-based protocols

the non-cluster-heads operate in the lower layer. as such, clustering routing protocols are usually referred to in the literature as hierar-

subsystems, as well as a power supply unit, in comparison with the non-cluster-heads. if the components of the cluster- heads are different from those in the non-cluster-heads, the clustering wsn is denoted as a heterogeneous clustering wsn; otherwise, it is a homogeneous clus- teringwsn(sect.4.4). clusteringalgorithmshavemanyobjectivesasportrayedinfig.4.12. in the multihop clustering technique,

their respective cluster members and forward such aggregated information to the basestation, either directly or via one or more relay nodes. for the cluster-heads, the relay nodes can either be a non-cluster-head node or a cluster-head node. this means that any of the nodes in the wsn can serve as a relay node to convey the aggregated message from the cluster-heads to the basestation as specified in the routingalgorithm.thecommunicationbetweenacluster-headandotherclusters,in ordertoconveythemessagefromitsclustermemberstothebasestation,isreferred toasinter1-cluster communication

thecluster-headsconsumemoreenergybecause theyperformfurther functions in comparison with the non-cluster-heads. hence, in order to avoid untimely net- work partitioning, it is always desirable to rotate the cluster-head duty and select nodes,withhigherresidualenergy,tooperateasthecluster-headineachround.by so doing, the load in the network is uniformly distributed among the nodes. fur- thermore, because thesource nodedoesnothavetoconveytheqbitpacketovera longdistancetothedestination,themultihopclusteringtechniquetechnicallysolves the distance problem associated with wsns, thereby

kuila and jana 2014b; malathi et al. 2015; arjunan and sujatha 2019). basically, it is perceived that equally distributing the nodes to clusters is a suitable approach to balance the intra-clustertrafficload;however,itsuffersduringinter-clustercommunications. specifically, the clusters closer to the basestation consume more energy in receiving and forwarding the traffic load from other distant clusters during inter-cluster communications, consequently causing an imbalance in the energy consumption during inter-cluster communications, which prompts a possible wsnpartitioning;thisphenomenonknownasthehot-spot/energy-holeproblem isdiscussedinsect.4.5. several approaches are suggested to mitigate the hot-spot/energy-hole problem whendevelopingaclustering-basedroutingprotocol: 2022 dividingthenetwork intounequalclusters.thesizeofeachclusterdependson howclosetheclusteristothebasestation.thatis,theclustersizeincreasesasthe distance of the cluster-heads from the basestation increases. multiple protocols areproposedinthisregard,specifically,(kuilaetal.2013;kuilaandjana2014a;

(4.3) (4.5), the q bits traffic load is directly proportional to the energy consumed; that is, the more the traffic q, the higher the energy consumed by the nodes in transmitting or receiving. thus, with multipath routing, the traffic load is shared among the nodes from the source toward the destination;in such a way, the wsn lifetime and functionality are prolonged for a reasonableperiod. in spite of the numerous advantages offered by multipath routing protocols, designing such protocols is challenging. a good multipath routing protocol adopts several considerations to select the multiple paths and evenly distribute the traffic 4.8 energy-efficientandenergy-balancedroutingprotocols 285 basestation source node fig.4.13 multipathload-balancedtreerouting.(basedonogundileandalfa(2017)) load over the selected paths. the main concerns to be addressed in designing a multipath routing protocol include path discovery, path selection/load distribution, andpathmaintenance(radietal.2012): 2022 path discovery. since multipath routing is designed based on the multihop communicationprinciple,thetaskofthepathselectionstageistofindthesetof relay nodes that will form the multiple paths from the source node toward the destination. 2022 pathselection/loaddistribution.afterselectingthesetofintermediatenodes,the numberofpathsthatdistributethetrafficloadisamainconcern. 2022 path maintenance. furthermore, as a result of resources constraints and the low batterypowerofsensornodes,theselectedpathsareusuallysusceptibletoerrors. asaplusofmultipathroutingprotocols,pathmaintenanceisanessentialfocusto helpensuringreliabledatatransmissionfromthesourcenodetothedestination. 4.8.1.2.2 single-pathapproach thesingle-pathtechniqueisaclassoftheload-balancedtreeroutingprotocol,where the source node finds a single energy-efficient and energy-balanced route to the basestation, as depicted in fig. 4.14. this technique is easy to implement and exhibits low complexity in comparison with multihop communication methods. moreover, it avoids delay in conveying the sensed information to the basestation, 286 4 energyandlifetimeawareroutingprotocolsforwsns basestation source node source node fig.4.14 single-pathload-balancedtreerouting.(basedonogundileandalfa(2017)) which is suitable in real-time communication. other advantages of the single-path load-balanced tree technique include easier congestion and interference control, as wellassimplerresourceutilization. although the design of a single-path load-balanced tree routing protocol can be quite simple in comparison to multihop communication methods, selecting the design decision metrics used in the path creation can be challenging. besides choosinganenergy-efficientandenergy-balancedpathfromthesourcenodetothe basestation,thechosenpathmustguaranteereliabledatatransmission.assuch,the design decision metrics must be carefully selected to ensure non-faulty data trans- mission and to extend the network lifetime for a reasonable period. hence, most single-path routing protocols select the path to the basestation using different mathematical formulations that involve various decision metrics that guarantee an energy-efficient and energy-balanced path. typical such metrics, as clarified in sects.4.2.1and4.2.2,arethetotalenergy(eghbalietal.2009),theaveragenetwork energy(zytouneetal.2010),thehop-count(hsiaoetal.2001;renetal.2011),the residualenergy(zhangetal.2014),andthedistancetothesink(kacimietal.2013; yaoetal.2015). thesemetricshaveprosandcons;hence,trade-offsarewatchedintheirselection. a trade-off is considered regarding the residual energy and the distance between nodes when selecting the path from the source node to the basestation (shah and rabaey2002;zhangetal.2014).thesensedinformationisforwardedtothenearest nodewithhighresidualenergy;hence,thetransmissiondistanceisreducedandthe forwarding node has sufficient energy to convey the sensed data, which also guarantees a reliable data transmission. using the residual energy and shortest distancebetweennodesascriteriadonotnecessarilybalancetheloadinthenetwork, 4.8 energy-efficientandenergy-balancedroutingprotocols 287 sinceitmightinvolvemanyhopsorrelaynodechainstoreachthebasestation.thus, moreenergywillbeconsumedintransmitting(eq.4.3)andreceiving(eq.4.5)the sensed information to/from thebasestation,respectively. thisimpliesthat thetotal energy consumed in the network might increase. so, it is desirable to keep the hop-count between the source node and the basestation as small as possible. with thisinmind,someliteraturecombinestheresidualenergy,distancetothesink,and hop-count to select the energy-efficient and energy-balanced path from the source nodetothebasestation(puccinelliandhaenggi2008;eghbalietal.2009;renetal. 2011). ametric, that explores thediversity in link qualities, takes into account the transmission and reception costs for a specific radio to choose an energy-efficient radio. the metric also uses the remaining energy of nodes in order to regulate the trafficsothatcriticalnodesareavoided(moadetal.2011). 4.8.2 single-hop communication inthesingle-hopcommunicationmethod,thesensedinformationisconveyedtothe basestationfromthesourcenodedirectly;thismethodwaslargelyusedintheearly discovery phase of wsns. figure 4.15 depicts a typical example of a single-hop clustering wsn, where the non-cluster-heads send their sensed information to the cluster-head directly without the help of any intermediate node. similarly, the cluster-heads forward the aggregated data from their cluster members directly to thebasestation. thesingle-hopcommunicationmethodoffersseveraladvantages: 2022 avoiding delay in data transmission, a useful attribute in real-time data transmission. 2022 preventing the hot-spot/energy-hole phenomenon, an important asset in design- ingroutingprotocols. cluster-head cluster 1 cluster-head cluster 3 basestation cluster-head cluster 2 fig.4.15 small-scalesingle-hopclusteringwsn.(basedonogundileandalfa(2017)) 288 4 energyandlifetimeawareroutingprotocolsforwsns 2022 ensuringreliabledatatransmissionwhileallthesensornodesarestillalive.since packets are sent directly to the basestation, reliability helps avoiding the loss of partsofthesensedinformation.inthemultihopcommunicationmethod,someof the sensed information could be missed while conveying the packet from one nodetoanothertowardthebasestation. since both the intra-cluster and inter-cluster1 communications in single-hop clustering-based routing protocols require no intermediate nodes, as in multihop clustering routing protocols, the cluster formation stages should be carefully designedinordertoevenlydistributethetrafficload,sothatthewsnlifetimeand functionality can be extended for an acceptable period (younis and akkaya 2008; khalilandattea2011;yueaetal.2012;wangetal.2012). the single-hop clustering approach does not necessarily solve the distance problem associated with the single-hop communication method. for example, in a large-scalewsn,somenon-cluster-headsmightbeatalargehop-distancefromtheir respective cluster-heads. moreover, some of the cluster-heads that are at a large distance from the basestation will continuously send the aggregated data, which might rapidly deplete their battery energy, consequently resulting in early wsn partitioningasclarifiedinfig.4.2. still,thesingle-hopcommunicationmethodisnotsuitableinalarge-scalewsn, wherethedistantnodeswillalwayssendtheirsensedinformationtothebasestation overalongdistance.so,theywilldepletetheirbatteryenergyquicklyincomparison withthenearbynodes,hencehamperingthenetworklifetimeandfunctionality.to extend the network lifetime and functionality for a reasonable period, different single-hop clusteringrouting protocolsareproposedtooptimizeseveralsingleand multiobjectiveproblemsassociatedwithwsns. inanalgorithmproposedtoimproveleachperformance,themetricsmeasured are wsn lifetime, number of cluster-heads, energy, and number ofpackets (wang etal.2012): 2022 for wsn lifetime, three metrics are used;

the less energy consumption per round the better is the wsn performance. 2022 the number of packets determines how many packets are received at the basestation. the more amount of packets received discloses less depletion rate of nodes and efficient energy expenditure. moreover, the proportion of residual energycanbeevaluatedfromthenumberofpackets. 4.9 energy-efficientroutingprotocolsforhomogeneousandheterogeneouswsns 289 also,fromadifferentalgorithm,thethroughputagainstenergyconsumedreflects theenergyefficiencyonaverage;ingeneral,thebiggeritis,thelongerthelifetimeof thewsn(linandwang2017). 4.9 energy-efficient routing protocols for homogeneous and heterogeneous wsns the network layer aims to realize the communication among sensors, between sensorsandobservers,dataroutingandcooperativesensing.wsnroutingprotocols mustbedesignedtomeetthedesiredperformancerequirementsinenergyefficiency, scalability,robustness,andconvergence(sect. 4.6).theirmaingoalistoestablish reliable andenergy-efficientpathsforwsn nodesandachievethelongestlifetime for the entire wsn. energy consumption in routing is caused by neighborhood discovery, communication, and computation. based on (yan et al. 2016), this section presents the energy-efficient routing protocols according to whether they areintendedforhomogenousorheterogeneouswsns.also,distinctivefromother classifications, care is aimed at static and mobile nodes. figure 4.16 illustrates the meantclassification. routing protocols for homogeneous wsns deal with identical nodes;

protocols in (konstantopoulos et al. 2012; wang et al. 2014) adopt a fixed trajectory, which is simple and convenient. but, energy consumption of nodes near the sink is relatively large, which cannot

makesitvulnerabletoattacks.securerouting,thus,needsattention(zhangetal. 2007; sakharkar et al. 2014). clearly a security mechanism incurs additional energy cost; consequently, there should be a proper trade-off between security levelsandenergyconsumptionfordifferentapplications. 2022 since there is wide spectrum of wsn applications, the process of routing implementation varies significantly from a wsn to another. thus, application- specificroutingprotocolsareneededforsuchsituationsasiot,vehicles,under- water, space, volcanoes, explorations, epidemic, human body, water and oil pipelines,

several restrictions that impact the design of the protocols that maintain their functioning, such as limited energy supply, reduced computing power, and small bandwidth of thewirelesslinksconnectingsensornodes.oneofthemaindesigngoalsofwsnsis to carry out data communication while targeting to prolong the lifetime of the network and prevent connectivity degradation by employing aggressive energy management techniques. depending on the application and the size of the wsn, different architectures and design goals constraints have been considered; clearly, theperformanceofaroutingprotocoliscloselyrelatedtothearchitecturalmodel. as made obvious throughout this chapter, multiple critical factors influence the selectionordesignofaroutingprotocol: 2022 wsn dynamics. the main components in a wsn are sensor nodes, sink and monitoredevents.inmostofthewsnarchitectures,sensornodesareassumedto bestationary.ontheotherhand,supportingthemobilityofsinksorcluster-heads is sometimes required. routing messages sent or received from nodes become more challenging since route stability turns to be an important optimization factor, in addition to energy and bandwidth. furthermore, the sensed event can be dynamic or static, depending on the application; thus, in a target detection application,theeventisdynamic,whileforestmonitoringforearlyfireprevention isastaticevent. 2022 nodes deployment. this affects the performance of the routing protocol; the deployment may be deterministic or self-organizing. in deterministic situations, the sensors are placed manually and all the data are routed through predefined 4.10 conclusionforgoodpaths 299 paths. in self-organizing systems, the sensor nodes are scattered randomly and createaninfrastructureinanadhocmanner. 2022 nodesmobility.nodesinthewsnareassumedtobestatic;yet,theinteresthas grown in applications that support

a route is greatly influenced by energy considerations. since the transmission power of a wireless radio depends on distancesquared,orinhigherorder,duetoobstacles,multihoproutingconsumes less energy than single-hop communication (sect. 4.2.1). however, multihop routing may add significant overhead for topology management and medium access control (sects. 4.5 and 4.8.1). in contrast, single-path routing performs wellenoughifallnodesareveryclosetothesink(sects.4.5and4.8.2). 2022 data delivery models. depending on the application of the wsn, the data delivery model to the sink can be continuous, event-driven, query-driven, or hybrid. in the continuous delivery model, each sensor sends data periodically. in event-driven and query-driven models, the transmission of data is triggered when an event occurs, or when the sink generates a query. moreover, there are somewsnsthatapplyahybridmodelusingacombinationofcontinuous,event- driven, and query-driven data delivery. routing protocols are based on the data delivery model, especially with regard to the minimization of energy consump- tionandroutestability. 2022 nodecapabilities.inawsn,differentfunctionalitiescanbeassociatedwiththe sensor nodes. in most wsns, a node can be dedicated to a particular function, which might be relaying, sensing or aggregation, since engaging the three functionalitiesonasinglenodemightquicklydrainitsenergy. 2022 dataaggregation/fusion.sensornodesmightgeneratesimilarpackets;aggregat- ing similar packet reduces the number of transmissions. data aggregation is the combination of data from different sources (sect. 4.3.2). this can be fulfilled through using functions such as suppression, min, max, and average. these

and4.8.1.2). 2022 does the protocol consider network security? importantly, apart from energy consumption, the security that protocols can offer is to protect against eavesdroppingandmaliciousbehavior(sect.4.9.3). 2022 how is the performance on real environment? most of the protocols for wsns have been evaluated through simulations. however, it is important to evaluate theirperformanceinrealenvironmentsandviatestbeds(chap.7). 2022 arebothreal-timeapplicationandqosconsidered?thereisanongoingneedto

(cid:129) congestion notification. after detecting congestion, transport protocols need to propagate congestion information from the congested node to the upstream sensornodesorthesource nodesthatcontributetocongestion.theinformation can be transmitted, using a single binary bit (called congestion notification (cn)bitin(stannandheidemann2003),ormoreinformationsuchasallowable data rate, as in (iyer et al. 2005), or the congestion degree, as in (wang et al. 2006a).disseminatingcongestioninformationhasatwofoldcategorization:   theexplicitcongestionnotificationthatusesspecialcontrolmessages,suchas suppressionmessages,tonotifytheinvolvedsensornodesofcongestion.   theimplicitcongestionnotificationthatpiggybackscongestioninformationin normaldatapackets.byreceivingoroverhearingsuchpackets,sensornodes can access the piggybacked information. for instance, the sensor nodes that detect congestion will set a cn bit in the header of data packets to be forwarded. after receiving packets with the cn bit set, the sink learns the networkstatus,congestionornocongestion.

(cid:129) the retransmission-based loss recovery method is more active and energy effi- cient,anditcanbeimplementedatboththelinkandtransportlayers.linklayer loss recovery is hop-by-hop, while the transport layer recovery is usually done end-to-end. loss recovery consists of loss detection and notification and retransmissionrecoveryaswillbepresentedinthefollowingsections. 5.2.3.1 lossdetectionandnotification since packet loss can be far more common in wsns than in wired networks, loss detection mechanisms have to be carefully designed. a common mechanism is to 318 5 transportprotocolsforwsns include a sequence number in each packet header; the continuity of sequence numbers can be used to detect packet loss. loss detection and notification can be either end-to-end or hop-by-hop. in the end-to-end approach, such as in the tcp protocol,theendpoints(destinationorsource)areresponsibleforlossdetectionand notification. in the hop-by-hop method, intermediate nodes detect and notify packetloss. forseveralreasons,theend-to-endapproachisnotthateffectiveforwsns: (cid:129) thecontrolmessagesthatareusedforend-to-endlossdetectionwouldutilizea returnpathconsistingofseveralhops,whichisnotenergyefficient.

(cid:129) the second stage is the noncore recovery phase, which involves noncore nodes requesting retransmission from the core nodes. a noncore node listens to all retransmissions from its core node and waits for completion before sending its ownretransmissionrequest. however, the approach followed by garuda might not be suitable for upstream data reliability. in the case of a very large wsn, the core construction andlossrecoverymightbeoverlylengthy.garudaonlyoffersreliabletransferof the very first packet without guaranteeing the remaining packets of a particular message. also, it does not provide a congestion control mechanism, and is only evaluatedthroughsimulation,notthroughtestbedexperimentation. 5.3.6 tiny tcp/ip tinytcp/iptendstomodifythetcp/ipprotocolsuitetomakeitviableforwsns, it also provides reliability that is a blend of end-to-end and hop-by-hop reliability (dunkels et al. 2003, dunkels et al. 2004). the protocol assumes that each sensor nodeknowsitsspatiallocationaprioriandfallsintoanyofthepredefinedsubnets. eachsensornodeobtainsthefirsttwooctetsfromthesubnetandcalculatesthelast twooctetsbasedonitsspatiallocationwithinthesubnet. tinytcp/ipproposesfourmodificationstotheexistingtcp/ipprotocols,spatial ip address assignment, shared context header compression, application overlay routing, and distributed tcp caching (dtc). sensor nodes on the same ip subnet donotneedtotransmitafullipheader.hence,theipheadercanbecompressedand shared among the sensor nodes of the same subnet. local ip broadcasting of udp datagramsisusedtoformanapplicationlayeroverlaynetworkontopofthephysical sensor network. finally, dtc provides packet reliability using a distributed approach. tinytcp/ipproposesanovelideaoftcppacketcachingwithinthein-network sensornodestominimizetheburdenoftheend-to-endretransmissionoffragments in case packet loss occurs. figure 5.1 shows a simplified example of how dtc works. inthis example,a tcp sender transmitsthree tcp segments. segment 1is cachedbynode5beforebeingdroppedinthenetwork,andsegment2iscachedby node7beforebeingdropped.whenreceivingsegment3,thetcpreceiversendsan 5.3 transportprotocolsforwsns 325 receiver 1 2 4 ack1 ack2 7 7 5 5 ack4 1 2 3 sender time fig.5.1 distributedcachingintinytcp/ip(rahmanetal.2008) acknowledgment (ack 1). when receiving ack 1, node 5, which had previously cached segment 1, performs a local retransmission. node 5 also refrains from forwarding the acknowledgment so that it does not have to travel all the way to the tcp sender. when receiving the retransmitted segment 1, the tcp receiver acknowledgesthissegmentbytransmittingack2.uponreceptionofack2,node 7, which previously had cached segment 2, performs a local retransmission. this way, the tcp receiver obtains the two dropped segments by local retransmissions fromsensornodesinthenetwork, withoutrequiringretransmissions fromthetcp sender.whentheacknowledgmentack 4isforwardedtothetcpsender,sensor nodes on the way can clear their cache and are thus ready to cache new tcp segments(rahmanetal.2008).intheworstcase,thereceiverfetchesthelostpacket fromthesenderifthispacketisnotcachedinanyintermediatenode.theprotocolis evaluatedthroughbothsimulationandanactualwsn. tinytcp/iplikelyexperiencessomeperformanceissues: (cid:129) the assumption of static spatial subnet ip makes it unsuitable for many of the mobility-supportedwsnapplications.

al. 2010). trccit provides desired application reliability, despite evolving network conditions, by adaptive retransmissions and suppression of unnecessary information. reliability of information transport is achieved by a hybrid acknowledgment (hack) mechanism aided by localized retransmission timer management. trccit efficiently monitors the information

networks (ertp) is designed for data streaming applications, in which sensor readings are transmitted from one or more sensor sources to a basestation (or sink) (le et al. 2009). ertp uses a statistical reliability metric, which ensures that the number of data packets delivered to the sink exceeds a defined threshold. extensive discrete event simulations and experimental evaluations show that ertp is significantly energyefficientandcanreduceenergyconsumption.consequently,sensornodesare moreenergyefficient,andthelifespanoftheunattendedwsnisincreased.

giving rise to a cross-layer approach, as presented in this section. worth noticing, several works in wsns have early revealed important interactions between the mac and network layers, leading to several propositions for the cross-layer design (melodia et al. 2005; pompili et al. 2006). 6.2.1.1.1 cross-layernetworkformationforenergy-efficientieee 802.15.4/zigbeewsns(panel)

thisisintendedtofacilitateenhancementsinthemacandnetworklayersseparately and easily consider other design concerns such as delay, quality of service, and congestion avoidance. clb has two phases, the initialization phase and the data transmission phase. in the initialization phase, the sink broadcasts a route request message to find suboptimal routes from each source node to the sink. then, in the data transmission phase, the mac layer informs the network layer about all the overheard communications of the neighboring nodes. with this information, a sending node can know how many times each forwarding node has routed data. accordingly,tobalancetheenergyconsumptionoftheforwardingnodes,asending node chooses its next hop among the less used. differently from several multipath routingprotocols,thechoiceofthenexthopisnotprobabilisticandleadstobetter balancingofenergyconsumption. before introducing clb in details, a differentiation from other approaches is highlightedinwhatfollows: 2022 the adaptive load-balanced algorithm (alba) was designed to consider load balancingandcongestion;itisapacketforwardingprotocolforadhocandsensor networks (casari et al. 2006). alba follows the integrated approach that com- binesgeographicroutingandmediumaccesscontrol(mac),thusexploitingthe knowledgeofnodepositionsinordertoachieveenergy-efficientdataforwarding (sect. 6.2.2). the considered scenario is critical for medium and high traffic, as contentions for channel access and the resulting collisions lead to performance degradation.tocounterthiseffect,leverageonnetworkdensityfavorsthechoice of relay candidates that are not overloaded. with alba, nodes strive to chan- nelize traffic toward uncongested network regions, rather than just maximizing the advancement toward the final destination. all eligible forwarder nodes of a source node calculate two indices in their path toward the sink, namely, the geographicpriorityindex (gpi)andthepriorityqueueindex (qpi). noticeably, theloadbalancingviewedinalbafocusesoncongestionavoidance,notenergy consumptionbalancingasstudiedinclb. 6.2 cross-layerdesignapproaches 361 2022 amany-to-onereal-timesensornetworkisconsidered,wheresensingnodesare to deliver their measurements to a basestation under a time constraint, with the overall target of minimizing the energy consumption at the sensing nodes (puccinellietal.2006).thequalityofthelinksandtheremainingenergyinthe nodesaretheprimaryfactors thatshape thenetwork graph;

i i that is, v two-hop neighbors are the neighbors of v one-hop neighbors after i i removing the duplicated nodes. the considered simple scenario embodies only onesourcenodeintheoutdoornetwork. the network embodies n sensor nodes randomly deployed. the locations of sensor nodes and the basestation are fixed and can be obtained using the gps. eachnodeknowsitsownlocationandthepositioninformationofitsone-hopand two-hop neighbors. the euclidean distance between any two node v and v is i j denotedasdist .boththesourceandthesinknodesareassumedwithunlimited i,j powersupply.eachsensornodeispoweredthroughrechargeablebatterieswith thecapabilityofharvestingsolarpowerfromoneadditionalsolarcell.theenergy harvesting rate and energy consumption rate in each individual sensor node are different andunpredictable,sincemanyfactorscanaffecttheenergylevel,such as the unstable local weather, the different number of one-hop neighbor nodes, andtheunexpectedquerytasksfromusers. also, each node uses an adjustable transmission power depending on its battery level. an example of such sensor nodes is berkeley motes (hill et al. 2000). instead of transmitting at maximum power, nodes take their energy resource into consideration and collaboratively adjust their transmission power accordingly. any node, if rich in residual energy, will have the ability of enlarging its maximum transmission radius;

successfully transport event information by constructing, as possible, mutihop pathstothesink.thecross-layerinitiativedeterminationconceptconstitutesthe core of the xlp and implicitly incorporates the intrinsic communication func- tionalities required for successful communication in wsns. a node i initiates transmission by informing its neighbors that it has a packet to send. this is achieved by broadcasting a request to send (rts) packet. upon receiving this packet, each neighbor of node i decides whether to participate in the communi- cation or to abstain. this decision is made through the initiative determination based on the current state of the node. the initiative determination is a binary operation where a node decides to participate in communication if its initiative

(6.25) (6.33). the objective of this component is to perform hop-by-hop congestion control thru exploiting the local information in the receiver contention and avoiding the need for end-to-end congestion control. it also exploits the local reliability measures taken by the channel access functionality and, consequently, doesnotnecessitatetraditionalend-to-endreliabilitymechanisms. inwsns,asensor node hastwo duties: explicitly,source dutyandrouterduty. accordingly,therearetwosourcesoftrafficasinputtoeachnodebuffer: 2022 generatedpackets.thefirstsourceistheapplicationlayer,i.e.,thesensingunitof anode,whichsensestheeventandgeneratesthedatapacketstobetransmitted. therateofthegeneratedpacketsisdenotedby  . ii 2022 relaypackets.inadditiontogeneratedpackets,asapartofitsrouterduty,anode also receives packets from its neighbors to be forwarded to the sink due to the mutihop nature of wsns. the rate at which node i receives relay packets from nodejisdenotedas  . ji since the sensor nodes utilize a duty-cycle operation, their buffer occupancy builds up while they sleep because of the generated packets, unless appropriate 1notethattheclockwise(counterclockwise)traversaldirectionreferstothetraversaldirectionof thepacketsratherthanthewaytheanglesaremeasured. 6.2 cross-layerdesignapproaches 383 actions are taken. the local cross-layer congestion control component of xlp has two main measures to regulate congestion: in router duty, by providing the sensor nodeswiththefreedomofdecidingwhetherornottoparticipateintheforwardingof the relay packets based on the current load on the node and, in source duty, by explicitlycontrollingtherateofthegeneratedpackets. the upper bound for the total relay packet rate that will prevent congestion is analyzedfirst.accordingly,adecisionboundisderivedforlocalcongestionateach node.more specifically,this bound,denotedby th ,isusedinthexlpinitiative relay determinationaspresentedineq.(6.24). theoverallinputpacketrateatnodei, ,canberepresentedas: i x   =    =       6:25  i ii i,relay ii j2 in ji i where   representsthegeneratedpacketrate ii   istherelaypacketratefromnodejtonodei ji  in depictsthesetofnodesfromwhichnodeireceivesrelaypackets i   istheoverallrelaypacketrateofnodei i,relay nodeiaimstotransmitallthepacketsinitsbuffer,andhence,theoveralloutput rateofnodeiisgivenby: (cid:2) (cid:3)   = 1 e (cid:1)      6:26  i i ii i,relay where e isthepacketerrorrate i 1+e approximatestheretransmissionratesincetheroutesareselectedbyconsid- i eringahighsnrvaluethroughtheinitiativedeterminationprocess noticeably,sincethenoderetransmitsthepacketsthatarenotsuccessfullysent, theoutputrateishigherthantheinputrate. accordingtoeqs.(6.25)and(6.26),inalongenoughinterval, t ,theaverage 1 timesnodeispendsintransmittingandreceivingaregiven,respectively,by: t =  (cid:1)t (cid:1)t  6:27  rx i,relay 1 pkt (cid:2) (cid:3) t = 1 e  (cid:1)     (cid:1)t (cid:1)t  6:28  tx i ii i,relay 1 pkt wheret istheaveragedurationtotransmitapackettoanothernodeincludingthe pkt mediumaccessoverhead. to prevent congestion at a node, the generated and received packets should be transmittedduringthetimethenodeisactive.becauseoftheduty-cycleoperation, ontheaverage,anodeisactive (cid:1)t sec.therefore: 1 384 6 cross-layerprotocolsforwsns (cid:4) (cid:5)  (cid:1)t    1 e (cid:1)   2 e (cid:1)  (cid:1)t (cid:1)t  6:29  1 i ii i i,relay 1 pkt consequently,theinputrelaypacketrate,  isboundedby: i,relay    th  6:30  i,relay i,relay wheretherelayratethreshold, th ,isgivenby: i,relay   1 e  th = - i(cid:1)   6:31  i,relay  2 e (cid:1)t 2 e ii i pkt i the above analysisshows that by throttlingtheinput relay rate, congestionata node can be prevented. this result is incorporated into xlp through a hop-by-hop congestioncontrolmechanism,wherenodesparticipateinroutingpacketsaslongas eq.

(6.24) to determine their initiative. more specifically, the inequality      max ensures that the buffer level,  , is lower than the threshold,  max, which is the maximum buffer length of a node. consequently, a node does not participate in communication,ifitsbufferisfull. inadditiontoregulatingtherelayfunctionalityasdiscussedabove,thexlplocal congestion control component also takes an active control measure by directly regulating the amount of traffic generated and injected into the network. during the receiver contention mechanism described earlier, node i may not receive any cts packets but receive keep-alive packets; in this case, it decides that there is congestion in the network. then, it reduces its transmission rate by decreasing the

therefore, the xlp node increases its generated packet rate linearly for each ack packet received. hence:   =     6:33  ii ii the xlp adopts a rather conservative rate control approach, mainly because

been recognized in oceans andwildlife, manufacturingmachineryperformance, building safety, earth- quake monitoring, and military arenas. the aspects of wsns have been under intense research, mainly on energy efficiency, network protocols, and distributed databases. however, relatively few works have been reported on security issues,

there are four fundamental securityrequirements,namely(xiaoetal.2006b): 2022 availability.theserviceofferedbywsnnodesshouldbeavailabletotheirusers wheneverexpected. 2022 authenticity of origin. the

powerrequirestheoperationstobedoneefficiently.moreover,becauseofthelarge- scaleanddistributednatureofwsns,theprotocolsandalgorithmsmustbescalable. a number of solutions have been proposed specifically forsecuring wsns (wood andstankovic2002;perrigetal.2002;liuandning2003;shiandperrig2004;hu etal. 2005;liu etal. 2005a).most ofthe solutionsdeal with attackstargeting one

understandably, multilayer solutions or cross-layer solutions can achieve better performance. furthermore, self-adaptive security services are flexible in dealing with the dynamic network

resultingfromcollisions,controlpacketoverhead,andunnecessarilyhightrans- missionpower.correspondingly,differentmethodsweredevelopedforreducing power consumption. some approaches limit the transmission power so as to increase the spatial reuse while maintaining network connectivity (wattenhofer et al. 2001; chen et al. 2002; santi 2005; wang 2008). at the network layer, power-aware routing protocols result in significant power savings (aslam et al. 2003; chang and tassiulas 2004). at the mac layer, the wireless transceivers canbeturnedoffwheneverpossible,toreducetheidlelisteningpoweraswellas the

2005). inorder to reduce powerconsumption, severalkey management techniqueswere tailored forwsns (yuandguan2008;zhangandvaradharajan2010;bechkitetal.2013).progres- sively, it has been conceived that power efficiency design cannot be addressed completelyatanysinglelayerofthewsnprotocolstack(minetal.2002). 6.3 cross-layerdesignforwsnssecurity 397 6.3.3 guidelines for securing wsns being aware of the challenges and limitations of layered security approaches, four guidingprinciplesariseasworthyofcareforsecuringwsns(jonesetal.2003): 2022 security of a network is determined by the security over all protocol layers. specifically, provisioning confidentiality, two-party authentication, and data freshness address security of the link layer. referring to fig. 6.23, it is clear that securing the link layer confers the layers above some security; however, it does not address security problems in the physical layer below, most notably jamming. an insecure physical layer may practically render the entire network insecure,evenifthelayersabovearesecure.thisisespeciallytrueinthewsn environmentsincebasicwirelesscommunicationisinherentlynotsecure. 2022 in a massively distributed network, security measures should be amenable to dynamic reconfiguration and decentralized management. given the nature of wsns, a security solution must work without prior knowledge of the network configuration after deployment. also, the security solution should work with minimal or no involvement of a central node to communicate, globally or regionally,sharedinformation. 2022 in a given network, at any given time, the cost incurred due to the security measures should not exceed the cost assessed due to the security risks at that time.thesensornetworkisexpectedtoexperiencedifferentmagnitudesofriskat different times, especially considering the, typically, long-lived nature of a network. in principle, security services should

coronaviruswasfirstdetectedinchinaandhasspreadinmore than213countries. thevirushasbeennamed sars-cov-2 andthediseaseitcauseshasbeennamed  coronavirus disease 2019  (covid-19). on january 30, 2020, the world health 404 6 cross-layerprotocolsforwsns organization (who) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of interna- tional concern (pheic). early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in wuhan, hubei province, china, had some link to a large seafood and liveanimalmarket,suggestinganimal-to-personspread.later,agrowingnumberof patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to- person spread. person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside hubei and in countries outside china. on wednesday, march 11, 2020, the coronavirus outbreakhasbeenlabeledapandemicbythewhochief.apandemicisdefinedasa disease that can infect and sicken humans, can transmit easily from one human to another, and has spread worldwide. pandemics occur when a new form of virus emerges (either a mutated version or a combination with another variation) and is capable of transmitting from person to person. as of submitting the book manu- script, the world has seen a total of 39,388,943 confirmed cases, 29,508,233 recoveries, and 1,105,915 deaths (worldometer 2020). the economic fallout was dangerous; there have been widespread supply shortages of

processing,andthenradiocommunications. 2022 eachnodeisconfiguredwiththesamepeer-to-peernetworkingprotocol,thereby allowingagroupofsensornodestoformaself-configuringnetwork. 2022 the sensor nodes are energy constrained since they are designed to operate in specificareasforyearswithnomaintenance. depending on the specific application for which they are used, wsns can be further divided into event-driven sensor networks or continuous monitoring sensor networks: 2022 onevent-drivensensornetworks,thenodesremaininthesleepmodeuntilsome event occurs,as inthecaseof asensor networkdevisedforsensingforestfires. however, the main problem with this type of networks is being able to switch nodesfromasleepingmodetoalisteningmodeinadefinedtime. 2022 on continuous monitoring sensor networks, data are continuously transmitted fromsourcenodestosinknodes. one of the main and foremost problems faced by wsns is that they are energy constrained, due to the fact that wsns consist of sensor nodes which are battery operated;therefore,itisimpossibletorechargethem,astheyareintendedtooperate 6.4 conclusionforreality 405 inspecificareasforyearswithnomaintenance.hence,itisimportanttodeviseways by which the energy efficiency of these sensor nodes can be increased so that the overalllifetimeofthenetworkisalsoimproved.cross-layertechniquescanachieve thegoalofmaximizingtheenergyefficiencyinwsns. cross-layer design is a new concept, which has been devised for protocols of wireless networks such as ad hoc networks and sensor networks. a significant number of papers have proposed the use of cross-layer techniques in wsns in order to achieve different objectives. furthermore, it has been proved that cross- layertechniqueshelptoimproveenergyconservationinwsns. withcross-layertechniques,thedifferentlayersoftheconventionalopensystem interconnection(osi)modelinteractwitheachother,irrespectiveoftheirpositions in the model, to achieve a specific result. the traditional osi layer architecture is modular in nature and has been implemented successfully in the case of wired networks.inthecaseofwsns,whichhavemanyconstraintsintermsofprocessing, memory, and energy, it becomes difficult to apply only the traditional protocol structure. cross-layer designs have emerged as an effective approach and have been applied to wsns. constraints on energy, memory, storage resources, and low radio transmission capabilities of the wireless sensor nodes make cross-layer supportmoreattractive. architecture is important for proliferation of technology, and at a time when wirelessnetworkingmaybeonthevergeofatakeoff,itsimportanceneedstobekept inmind.inventuringintothespaceofcross-layerdesign,itmay,however,beuseful to note some adverse possibilities and exercise appropriate attention (kawadia and kumar2005): 2022 unbridled cross-layer design can lead to a spaghetti design and stifle further innovationssincethenumberofnewinteractionsintroducedcanbelarge. 2022 suchdesigncansuppressproliferationsinceeveryupdatemayrequirecomplete redesignandreplacement. 2022 cross-layer design creates interactions, some intended and others unintended. dependency relations may need to be examined, and timescale separation may need to be enforced. the consequences of all such interactions need to be well understood,andtheoremsestablishingstabilitymaybeneeded.

cross-layering is a wsn specificity, and it deserves more attention, further exploration. 6.5 exercises note:atechnicalreportfollowsthetemplateofapeer-reviewedjournalpaper. 1. search the literature

currentsurveysandforecastspredictthatthenumberofwirelessdevicesisgoing to increase tremendously. these wireless devices can be computers of all kinds, notebooks, netbooks, smartphones, and sensor nodes that evolve into real-world scenarios forming in the future a  real-world internet.  in current research of the futureinternet,smallbattery-drivendevicesformingthe internetofthings areof special focus as the number of wireless devices is going to increase tremendously. a survey of the wireless world research forum predicted that in the year 2017, there will be seven trillion wireless devices

inthecontextoffutureinternetandwsns.thisdevelopment stems fromthefact that simulations and even emulations are not considered sufficient for the deploy- ment of new technologies as they often lack

motesandthemultiplicityofcomponentsusedintypicaltestbedimplementations. 7.1.1 requirements from testbed deployment this section identifies the main requirements and design goals for a wsn testbed. precisely, all phases of the sensor network life cycle are to be considered, specifi- cally, design, deployment, test, and experiment implementation and evaluation. a testbed solution supporting these features will offer substantial help in terms of 7.1 wsntestbedsprinciples 417 speedingupthepreparationandconductingofexperimentswithdifferentsuesand tuning their parameters. as such, a testbed, which is expected to replicate an environment and support all research and experimentation activities, must meet a number of requirements (lundgren et al. 2002; handziski et al. 2006; slipp et al. 2008): 2022 building different sue architectures. a number of different wsn architectures have emerged. as previously elaborated in chap. 3, in the flat architecture the sensor network is composed of homogeneous sensor nodes running the same application and protocol code. in a segmented architecture, a number of flat networks are coupled by gateways. the different flat networks can use incom- patibleradiotechnologies.inamultitierarchitectureorhierarchicalarchitecture, a sensor network application is partitioned such that parts of it run on low-end sensor nodes, whereas other parts run on more capable high-end sensor nodes which have no energy constraints and have better memory and computational resources. an example is the ieee 802.15.4 protocol, where the full-function devices (ffds) have much more responsibilities than the reduced-function devices (rfds) (lan/man standards committee 2006). in addition to being connected to the low-end nodes, the high-end nodes can interact among them- selvesandwithentitieshigherinthehierarchyviaabackbonenetwork. 2022 instrumentation and experimental control. the testbed must provide instrumen- tation for generating data and examining network performance. facilities must also be provided to monitor, program, test, and run the sue. it is awkward to obtain an adequate understating of the behavior of some networks without comprehensiveinstrumentation. another requirement in the setup of experiments is to have control over the timeswhencertainactionsliketheconfigurationorstartofsensornodeshaveto be performed. for example, to investigate the influence of interference on the transmissionofdatabetweentwonodes,thetransmittingnodeandtheinterfering node should be started at the same time. it is practically simple for an experi- mentertodescribesuchscenariosandhavethemexecutedinthetestbed. the testbed must also ensure programmable configuration of network and node parameters such as application selection, data logging, selection of the nodes that will participate, and ability to pause, resume, and stop experiments. repeatability of experiments is a requirement to account for varying environ- mentalnecessitiesandfunctionalparameters. foranindustrialenvironment,thetestbedmayhavetoreplicatethemultipath that exists in radio harsh environment (rhe) and provide for the control of electromagnetic interference (emi) that would particularly exist. it should also provide control over signal strength to enable testing under varying signal strengthconditions;thisincludeseffectsduetochangesindistance. 2022 easy reprogramming and debugging. the implementation and debugging of sensor network applications requires frequent reprogramming of the nodes with new software. this is needed to compare different solutions, but most critically for stepwise debugging and improving of the software. there exist approaches 418 7 testbedsforwsns (and protocols) to distribute new application code within the sensor network application and over the wireless interface (wan et al. 2002; hui and culler 2004), but this can be tedious in case of low-communication bandwidth and sporadicreachabilityof individualnodes. itistherefore desirable tosupportthe reprogrammingofnodesinan out-of-band fashionusingthetestbedinfrastruc- ture. to save time, especially in large testbeds, the reprogramming of nodes shouldbeexecutableinparallel.fixingbugsonsinglenodescanbeahardtask and it gets considerably more complicated in a distributed system like a wsn, where individual nodes only contribute slightly to the global state, and race conditions can cause serious headache to the programmer. determining the current state of the system and how it was reached is crucial for distributed debugging. however, hosting a distributed debugger that allows a complete  happened- before orderingoftheeventssimplyexceedsthecomputationalcapacitiesofthe sensornodes.atestbedshouldprovidesomesupportfordistributeddebugging. simply,theprogrammerofasensornodeshouldhavesomeprintf()-likeroutine for generating debug messages with additional timestamping at its disposal. whenthetimestampshaveareasonableresolutionandareproperlysynchronized with the timestamps generated at other nodes, it is possible to figure out the ordering of events. noteworthy, generating messages with debug information changestheexecutiontimingofthesensornodesoftwareandhencepossiblyits behavior. this cannot be avoided, but a testbed should give the possibility to transportsuchdebugmessagesinan out-of-band fashion,i.e.,withoutusingthe primarywirelessairinterfaceofasensornode.thisway,thedebugmessagesdo not influence the protocol behavior or the bandwidth sharing between sensor nodes,norisanyadditionalcongestioncreated. 2022 on-the-fly configuration changes. the main purpose of a testbed is the investi- gationofdifferentsolutionsinreproducibleexperimentsundercontrolledcondi- tions.checkingtherobustnessofapplicationsandprotocolsagainstnodefailures or addition of new nodes is one of the major experiments to be conducted. a wsn testbed should offer support for testing this robustness under realistic circumstances.specifically,itshouldbepossibletoemulatetheexpiryofsensor nodesduetoenergydepletion(faultinjection)ortheadditionofnewnodestothe networkwhileassuringcompleterepetitivenessoftheexperimentacrossdifferent softwaresolutions. energy consumption is one of the major performance metrics of sensor network protocols and applications. sensor nodes often have finite energy bud- getsandsensornetworkshavehighlytime-variabletopologiesduetotheenergy depletionofnodesanddeploymentofnewnodes. 2022 remote accessibility. the testbed must be remotely accessible to promote col- laboration between geographically dispersed teams. working conditions may vary depending on the location, as well as mote types and software, which necessitateexchangeofinformationinordertoreachthebestpossibleinstallation andequipment. 7.1 wsntestbedsprinciples 419 2022 testbed management. in wsn applications, having unique node identifiers is usuallynotoverlyimportant.butthisdoesnotapplytotestbedmanagement.to keep the testbed operational, it is important to correctly identify nodes, for instance, to decide whether experimental results pertain to the operation of the sueorwhethertheyaretheresultofmisconfigurationand/ormalfunctioningof the sensor nodes. malfunctioning nodes must be identified and replaced before theexperiment isrepeated.tothisend,knowledge oftheexactidentifierofthe nodesanditspositionishelpful.sincetheexchangeofnodesinatestbedwillbea frequent event (especially in large testbeds), the node identifiers and their posi- tions should be independent of each other, i.e., the node identifier should not encode its position or vice versa. to find malfunctioning nodes, an association betweennodeidentifiersandpositionsshouldbenonethelessmaintained.ideally, thisassociationisautomaticallyupdatedeverytimeanodeisaddedorremoved from

extensibility. it is not only a general requirement for sensor networks, but also the testbed infrastructure should support nontrivial numbers ofsensornodes.considerasanexamplethecontinuousgenerationofdebugdata or the gathering of application data. data from all sensor nodes are required to

protocols and communication concerns on the testbed before typical wsn implementation, modification, or extension. from a user standpoint, several requirements are necessary to make testbeds useful and efficient (chatzigiannakisetal.2010): 2022 transparentaccesstothetestbed.transparencyinthiscontextmeansthatsensor nodesinaremotetestbedcanbehandledinthesamewayaslocalsensornodes. in order to use the testbed, a robust, fast, and simple reservation is essential, includingsupportforisolated(noninterfering)experimentswithotherusers. 2022 heterogeneity and scale ofthe testbeds. they are significant inorder toaddress challenges that occurin real-worlddeployment scenarios. manyalgorithms and applicationsdonotscaleorbehaveunstablyinlargescale;therefore,thenetwork size should be as large as possible. as deployment cost is still a dominating factor,theconceptoftestbedfederationtoenableexperimentsatscalecanhelpto reduce overall facility cost. to enable federation standardization, application program interfaces (apis) is a key concept if not a prerequisite. in the same way, heterogeneity can affect the performance of an application. heterogeneity mightincludememory(programanddata),wirelesstransceivercharacteristics,or microcontroller. heterogeneity can be introduced by using different classes of devices from an embedded 8-bit microcontroller platform to a fully equipped pc. a full support of a testbed for heterogeneity even allows performing inter- operabilitytests. 2022 reproducibility. it is a property that is very difficult to achieve

for a next step extensionbymobiledevices. 7.1.1.3 operatorrequirementsfromatestbed the operator is the one who checks the testbed access and the functioning of its constituents, obtains the required measurements, and reports malfunctions. the operator requirements additionally include several qualities that make testbeds handytomanage(chatzigiannakisetal.2010): 2022

specifically,twodistinctapproachesaretaken(maltzetal.2001;deetal.2005a): 2022 full-scale testbeds that provide propagation over the actual distances where the networkisdesignedtooperate 2022

testbeds take up a lot of space, require considerable infrastructure, and are relatively expensive to operate. miniaturized testbeds can

optimized to operate over varied radio technologies and restricted resources under specific deployment strategies. the most commonly

image), as needed. for energy conservation, the resource manager has the meerkats  sensor node operating on a duty-cycle basis, i.e., the node periodically wakesup,performssometasksasneeded,andgoesbacktoeitheridleorsleepmode. while sleep is the mode with the lowest power requirements, idle mode has a number of variations. at a minimum, the processor is awake and ready to work, even though there are no active processes running. other variations of idle are as follows: resourcemanager visual processing communication visual sensornodehardware 2022

visualprocessing the visual processing module performs all vision-related tasks, including image acquisition, compression, and processing; it is invoked by the resource manager after activating the

between nodes and the sink is based on 802.11b links. multihop routingisperformedusingthedynamicsourcerouting(dsr)protocol(johnsonand maltz 1996). this is an on-demand routing mechanism especially designed for multihop wireless ad hoc networks. the version of dsr running on the meerkats  nodes was ported from the dsr kernel module available for the pocketpc linux (song2001). two types of data are handled by the application layer, specifically, control packets exchanged between nodes via udp for synchronization and alerting and image data transmitted from nodes to the sink via tcp. the sink runs a multithreaded server program that listens for connection requests from sensor nodes, opens a connection, receives image files, and renders images on the sink s console. experiments revealed sporadic instability problems using the 802.11b links. in ordertominimizetheeffect ofthisinstability,asimple faultrecoveryprocedureis implemented: 2022

embeddedsystemtechnology(nest)teamatohiostateuniversity,foruseinthe exscal project. each xsm is equipped with a 7.3-mhz 8-bit cpu, 128-kbyte instruction memory, and 4-kbyte ram. for communication, the mote uses a 433-mhz low-power radio. the radio s reliable communication range is between 15 and 30 m when placed on ground level. each mote accommodates a variety of sensors, such as a photocell, a passive infrared (pir), a temperature and a magne- tometer sensor, and a microphone. the motes run tinyos (tinyos 2012),

systems, and libraries. for instance, while for some platforms such as xsm (arora et al. 2005) and telosb (moteiv 2004) the default is to program on bare metal, others such as imote2 (crossbow 2005), sunspot(ritter2007;tantisureepornandarmstrong2008),andstargate(cross- bow 2004b) host their own operating systems. moreover, the execution environ- ments in these platforms vary from a simple file download and programming the flashtocommandlineinterfacesandvirtualmachines. 7.2 testbedsillustrated 515 all of the above necessitates an experiment specification language that enables researchers to configure slices in a generic manner. intuitively, an experiment specification should include the resource description that the experiment is to run

includesproceduraldescriptions(orworkflowelements).unlikeresourcespecifica- tions where readability is not important, experiment specifications should provide good readability since a researcher might

is a general-purpose testbed thatusesrobotstoprovidemobilitytowsnnodes;ithasbeenopenforpublicuse until 2008 and was popular for research on mobile wsns (johnson et al. 2006). mobile emulab is designed to provide unified access to a variety of experimental environments: 2022 aweb-basedfrontend,throughwhichuserscreateandmanageexperiments. 2022 a core that manages the physical resources within a testbed. it consists of a database and a wide variety of programs that allocate, configure, and operate testbedequipment. 2022 numerous back ends which interface to various hardware resources. back ends include interfaces to locally managed clusters of nodes, virtual and simulated nodes,andaplanetlabinterface(sect.7.2.13.2). mobile emulab uses a modular and distributed architecture and is

withmultipleusersatthesametime,andmostimportantlyscalability. sensenetsatisfiesseveraldesignfeatures: 2022 absenceofawiredbackchannel.thecommonfactinothertestbedapproachesis the existence of a wired backchannel that is used for reprogramming, data logging, and network monitoring purposes. this implies that an ethernet or usb channel exists through which newer versions of code are downloaded to the mote; also, packets originating from that mote are uploaded to a sink. the benefitofthisapproachisthatthewirelesslinkisleftfreeforpurelyapplication purposes at the expense of increasing cost, maintenance problems, and reduced scalability. 2022 absenceofsupernodes.insomeimplementations(duttaetal.2006;handziski et al. 2006), as illustrated in sects. 7.2.7 and 7.2.8, there exist some nodes with advanced capabilities compared to those of the motes. their existence offers 7.2 testbedsillustrated 525 solutions to problems like addressing a remote node, aggregating packets, forwarding traffic between different types of networks, or acquiring the role of a cluster head in a routing protocol. however, such approach might reduce scalability as the administrators, and sometimes users,

underwaterorsurfacevehiclesarerarelyfoundinubiquitousroboticstestbeds. while low cost, low size, and low energy constrain the features of sensors integrated in wsn platforms, robots can carry and provide mobility to sensors with higher performance. moreover, wsns were designed for low-rate and low-range communications, whereas wi-fi networks, typically used by multirobot systems, can provide up to 36 mbps experimental bound at greater distances. as camera networks are frequent in ubiquitous robotics testbeds, they mostly adopt schemes with decentralized image processing for scalability and bandwidth effi- ciency. also, the popularization and improvement of performance of smartphones andpdashaveboostedtheiruseintestbeds. 7.2 testbedsillustrated 527 basically, testbeds need an
