At present, forest fire monitoring techniques based on wireless sensor networks have drawn more and more attention from both academic and forestry field. In order to reduce the cost of monitoring system, it is necessary to monitor a biggest area with sensor nodes of given number. In this paper, based on the forest fire circular propagation model, the case where the sensors are located in a regular triangle grid is analyzed. Some results which relate the sensor node density to the forest fire monitoring quality are presented. The theoretical analysis and the results of Monte Carlo simulations show that, the expect value of the time to fire detection is proportional to the ration of node density to the fire propagation speed, and the expect value of burned area only depends on the node density, but it doesn’t depend on the distribution of the fire ignition and fire propagation model.","","978-1-4244-6328-2","10.1109/CMC.2010.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5471587","wireless sensor networks;forest fire;node density;simulation","Fires;Wireless sensor networks;Costs;Forestry;Sensor systems;Ignition;Remote monitoring;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Laboratories","","1","","9","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the network is unaware of the fault, it might lead to a serious problem. So, our objective is to detect the faulty nodes as well as the probability of fire to reduce the disastrous loss.

Our idea is to have Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) placed in a widely distributed manner across the forest area. Each module consists of a smoke sensor, temperature, humidity sensor, and a speaker which is connected to a Node-MCU. These modules collect data that is necessary for the prediction of wildfires. The data collected is analyzed along with the wind direction by our deep learning algorithm which predicts the wildfire spreading direction. This prediction is used to find a safe route for the animals to move away and get to a safe zone. Then the animals are manipulated to move away from the wildfire with the help of distressing sounds produced from the speaker triggering their flight response for their self-preservation. These distressing sounds are produced in a pattern rather than just producing it wherever wildfire is present. Hence leading wildlife to a safe zone And also nearby villages can be warned by a siren.","","978-1-6654-1447-0","10.1109/ICCCT53315.2021.9711785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9711785","forest fire;deep learning;grids;module;sensors;self-preservation","Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Computational modeling;Wildlife;Fires;Forestry;Humidity","","4","","15","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The forest fire detection as a monitoring network is one of these applications. Sensors collect dynamic changes such as temperature, humidity, smoke, atmospheric pressure and forward those to a single node or a base station. These informations are sent to a long-distance data server which is located in a fire center. Due to the importance of these networks and their ability of real-time monitoring, they should be a reliable network communications. On the other hand, due to the limitations of sensors in processing, memory and energy resource, we need protocols that consider these limitations, especially energy. Energy consumption is important because sensors are often remote, or are located in hazardous areas. Typically, the energy resources are very small batteries that are not rechargeable and replaceable. In this paper, the performance of three routing protocols: AODV, DSR, DSDV in the forest fire detection application based on a zigbee wireless sensor network are compared. The metrics for this comparison are average end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption. We evaluate their performance using NS-2. Our results show that AODV is the best between these three protocols regarding packet delivery ratio but is the worst regarding energy consumption.","","978-1-4673-6490-4","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620073","wireless sensor network;forest fire detection;Zigbee;routing protocol;AODV;DSR;DSDV","Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Fires;Energy consumption;Sensors;Routing","","10","","10","IEEE","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dealing with these unfortunate incidents is not that easy because forests are complex terrains. Wireless sensor networks are free from huge infrastructures and hence are best suitable in such scenarios. However, deploying nodes for coverage and communications is a crucial task in such not-so-convenient areas. Therefore, several factors are to be considered while designing such systems, right from deciding the topology of the network, the parameters, environmental factors to the best simulation software which can be used to achieve the best results. This analysis highlights all these factors and presents the most dominant criteria that can be considered while designing such a forest fire detection system. This analysis of the optimal parameters and software tools and considerable research gaps would aid researchers in developing a design methodology for such kind of wireless sensor networks-based forest fire detection systems.","","979-8-3503-9523-5","10.1109/ICMCSI61536.2024.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494001","Wireless Sensor Networks;Forest Fire Monitoring;Parameters;Topology;Evaluation Parameters","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Systematics;Network topology;Forestry;Ad hoc networks;Topology","","","","18","IEEE","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to their uncontrolled unpredictable rapid growth and behaviour, they can quickly become difficult to contain, leading to significant loss of lives, wildlife and property. It is therefore critical to tackle such fires in the early stages. This demands a reduction in the initial time to detection while ensuring reliability and a low false alarm rate. This paper discusses a new category of compact, easily deployable and energy efficient approach to sensor nodes for the continued monitoring of forest environments as well as the early detection of fires in their infancy based on a combination of sensory inputs.

Therefore, to reduce damage caused by occurrence of forest fires, it is important to detect fires in their early phase. This paper put forth a realistic method to detect wildfires at an early stage using sensor networks and machine learning in combination. Algorithms for machine learning use data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions. Machine learning models are algebraic representations of patterns and relationships in the data. Different kinds of models exist, for example, decision trees, neural networks, linear regression and others. The problem at hand determines the model to choose.

Hence, there is a need for a 24/7 forest fire monitoring system that will generate alerts in near real-time. In this paper, we discuss a WSN based solution with visualization and alert generation schemes. The system has been developed and field-tested. The sensors in the system monitor environmental parameters during an outbreak of a forest fire. Sensor data gets processed and upon detection of the outbreak of a fire, alerts are issued to the concerned forest officials. Experimental analysis of sensor node behaviour during a fire in a test set-up has been discussed in detail.

In this paper, an optimal band selection strategy is proposed, considering the characteristics of the Earth surface, atmosphere, and targets as well as the influence of multispectral sensor system. Based on the spectral characteristics of the Earth surface and atmosphere, the spectral irradiances at sensor aperture from backgrounds and targets are calculated using an atmospheric radiative transfer model. Spectral response functions with different central wavelengths and bandwidths are used to calculate the intensity of the background and target radiations in specific bands. The contrasts of the targets to the backgrounds in these bands are analyzed to generate a two dimensional matrix. For a single target, the local maxima of the contrast matrix are selected as the optimal bands. When an optimal band is selected for multiple targets with different spectral characteristics, a scoring matrix is obtained for each target via grading the contrast matrix according to a specified threshold and the global maximum. The scoring matrices of all targets are integrated to generate an evaluation matrix where the local maxima correspond to the optimal central wavelengths and bandwidths. Optimal band selection of space-based multispectral sensors for wildfire detection is taken as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed strategy.","","978-1-5386-1663-5","10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233252","","Atmospheric modeling;Fires;Bandwidth;Surface waves;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Atmospheric waves","","1","","16","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strength of the trees has drastically decreased which lead to unhealthy forest environment. It has been analyzed from the yearly survey that 85% losses in forest calamities are due to wild fire. In recent years, few works have been carried out on forest management using wireless sensor networks. However, forest management with the help of wireless sensor networks are still having issues in the quality of data, delay in arrival. Currently there is big wave of IoT and Edge computing deployed in lot of smart city applications for processing the data closer to devise for quick action rather than cloud. Also issue of bandwidth, latency and delay in processing data is avoided with Edge/Fog computing in IoT. So, with this as basis, we propose an IoT-Fog based Forest Fire Monitoring system.

It is shown that this could be done analyzing the noise power spectrum of forest fires: surface fires noise spectrum can be modeled as the red noise (gradual increase of trend line amplitude toward lower frequencies), while for crown fires noise spectrum trend line has an almost bell-shaped (Gaussian) type. The noise frequency range is relatively narrow for crown fires and ranged from 250 to 450 Hz. The intermediate type of fires (strong surface fire and incipient crown fire) has a transient noise spectrum from broadband red to narrowband Gaussian.

Basically, two of these protocols are based on the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol with some modification to suit the forest fire detection application. These protocols are called Persistent CSMA (P-CSMA) and Per Hope Synchronization CSMA (PHS-CSMA). The third one is a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)-based protocol, called Sensor TDMA (S-TDMA). These three protocols are investigated and analyzed by simulation. Results show that there is no superior protocol which outperforms others in terms of power consumption, delay and complexity. However, a trade-off does exist. In terms of power consumption, S-TDMA outperforms other protocols but it has the worst performance in terms of delay. On the other hand, considering the design complexity, S-TDMA is the most complex as it needs time synchronization over the entire cluster while PCSMA and PHS-CSMA don't require time synchronization between nodes.","0840-7789","978-1-4244-3509-8","10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090147","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Fires;Wireless sensor networks;Access protocols;Energy consumption;Delay;Multiaccess communication;Time division multiple access;Collision avoidance","","2","","8","IEEE","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such disaster, an effective and reliable routing protocol in terms of energy consumption is much needed for continuous monitoring. This paper presents a new routing protocol named Power Consumption Efficient-Optimized Link State Routing (PCE-OLSR) protocol in the forest fire detection. PCE-OLSR protocol exploits the energy of the nodes that is located in the fire zone in order to fully utilize its energy and consequently preserved the energy of other nodes in the network.

But one of the reasons for such significant losses is IoT technology. The forest fire alarm is installed in an inappropriate location and delays the alarm, causing serious damage. This paper focuses on using IoT technology to design appropriate sensor values for surface forest fire alarm systems.

These events are mainly caused by the actions of humans, but different nature and environmental phenomena, like lightning strikes or spontaneous combustion of dried leafs or sawdust, can also be credited for their occurrence. Regardless of the reasons for the ignition of the forest fires, they usually cause devastating damage to both nature and humans. Forest fires are also considered as a main contributor to the air pollution, due to the fact that during every fire huge amounts of gases and particle mater are released in the atmosphere. To fight forest fires, different solutions were employed throughout the years. They ware primary aimed at the early detection of the fires. The simplest of these solutions is the establishment of a network of observation posts - both cheap and easy to accomplish, but also time-consuming for the involved people. The constant evolution of the information and communication technologies has led to the introduction of a new generation of solutions for early detection and even prevention of forest fires. ICT-based networks of cameras and sensors and even satellite-based solutions were developed and used in the last decades. These solutions have greatly decreased the direct involvement of humans in the forest fire detection process, but have also proven to be expensive and hard to maintain. In this paper we will discuss and present two different emerging solutions for early detection of forest fires. The first of these solutions involves the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with specialized cameras. Several different scenarios for the possible use of the drones for forest fire detection will be presented and analysed, including a solution with the use of a combination between a fixed-wind and a rotary-wing UAVs. In the next chapter of the paper, we will present and discuss the possibilities for development of systems for early forest fire detection using LoRaWAN sensor networks and we will analyse and present some of the hardware and software components for the realisation of such sensor networks. The paper will also provide another point-of-view, which will present the involvement of students in the development and in the use of both systems and we will analyse the advantages and the benefits, which the students will gain from their work on and with these solutions.","2472-7687","978-1-5386-7711-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2018.8534245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8534245","early forest fire detection;LoRaWAN;sensor network;unmanned aerial vehicles;drones","Fires;Forestry;Cameras;Drones;Europe;Aircraft","","23","","16","IEEE","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

D-S evidence theory can make use of collected data to predict wildfire. Due to the possible conflict of the collected data, the accuracy of the theory is not high in predicting the mountain fire. In order to solve this problem, this paper improved the traditional D-S evidence theory, combined with the theory of hierarchical analysis to reduce the conflict between data, and finally improve the accuracy of mountain fire prediction. In this paper, the accuracy rate of risk prediction and cost expenditure are used as the measurement basis for accurately predicting mountain fires. When the accuracy of risk prediction is higher, the accuracy of mountain fire prediction algorithm is higher. The lower the cost used, the higher the accuracy of the fire prediction algorithm. The risk prediction accuracy of the improved D-S evidence theory is 1, which is 40% higher than the traditional accuracy. The cost of the improved D-S evidence theory is 11 units less than that of the traditional theory.

One such catastrophic situation humans tend to face is wildfire, and the damages it creates are uncertain. Fire-like objects and small-size fire objects have a high false alarm rate. Wildfire is one of the most common hazards and natural threats to biodiversity, disturbing the ecology and environment of a region. Natural causes such as lightning and man-made causes are significant sources of forest fires. If the wildfire goes unnoticed, it cannot be controlled quickly, and hence the impact of these disastrous effects can result in massive damage to human properties and areas of vegetation. On average, 62,963 wildfires occur worldwide annually and affect millions of hectares. And such impacts could be avoided if there were systems available for monitoring and early detection of the wildfire. Flame detectors, smoke detectors, and temperature detectors are examples of early fire detection technologies that are inadequate in the event of a widespread wildfire. Sensor-based and image-processing-based technology is two types of existent technology. On the other hand, with the help of real-time surveillance cameras, constant and accurate monitoring under deep learning-based automatic wildfire detection is possible. Hence we initiate architecture with DenseNet for wildfire detection and avoidance of false alarms, using a mixed dataset of fire-like objects and non-fire objects which is definitive for wildfire detection excluding false alarms","","978-1-6654-5262-5","10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984493","Wildfire;DenseNet;CNN","Temperature sensors;Temperature;Biological system modeling;Surveillance;Fires;Vegetation mapping;Detectors","","2","","10","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of interconnected physical devices that allow everyday items to communicate with one another and share data over an online network The primary goal of this article is to use temperature, humidity, and other variables to forecast the fire’s future trajectory. To improve the efficacy of the fire detection process, an Internet of Things (IoT) based system may receive data on humidity and temperature from a variety of sensors. For the purpose of avoiding the need to achieve high reliability prevention, the proposed Io T based forest fire detection mechanism (IoTFFD) can use a threshold value of each sensor to validate the data. To test how well the scheme worlss, it is cross-validated with the conventional Smart Forest Fire Identifier (SFFI). This system presents the architecture of an IoT framework for monitoring and avoiding forest fires. To avoid a disaster (a forest fire) that could lead to the loss of many natural resources, wildlife, and human lives, it is necessary to first understand how to integrate a valid network architecture that can detect possible changes in the ecosystem. This will allow us to begin investigating the causes of forest fires and developing effective prevention strategies. Our device’s primary function is to use GSM, a buzzer, and the Internet of Things to identify a forest fire and sound an alert. A variety of sensors are integrated into the system’s architecture; these sensors are crucial for identifying forest fires and notifying local residents. In addition, the monitored region may be tracked in real-time through the IOT portal.

This study presents the architecture, components, and operational workflow of this innovative system, highlighting its potential to revolutionize forest fire management. The proposed system primarily centers around the development of a fire detection system utilizing the ESP 32 microcontroller, which is interconnected with an MQ3 sensor, a flame sensor, and a Neo 6m GPS module. Initially, these two sensors will be deployed within forested areas to identify occurrences of fire and smoke. Upon detection of fire or smoke, the GPS module will be activated to pinpoint the location. Through the utilization of the GPS module, the detected location of fire or smoke is transmitted via the Blynk app, and an alarm is triggered. In contrast to the current method, wherein sensors transmit information about potential forest fire locations to an Arduino for subsequent GPS-based detection and SMS alerting via GSM, this proposed system streamlines the process by integrating real-time GPS tracking and immediate alerting through the Blynk app.","","979-8-3503-4023-5","10.1109/ICACRS58579.2023.10404409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10404409","Forest Fire Detection;Firefighting Resources;Real-time GPS Location Tracking;Global positioning system;Sensor Integration;Forest Fire Management;Emergency Preparedness","Microcontrollers;Wildlife;Sociology;Forestry;Real-time systems;Statistics;Global Positioning System","","1","","23","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But one of the best ways to detect fire is using image classification in which Deep learning is the most effective solution. By using deep learning techniques these response systems can be added or configured with drones so that images can be clicked easily form the sky on regular basis and detect smoke in dense forest and alert the authorities so that action can be taken as fast as possible. In our model we focused on fire detection using CNN and RCNN method and results are achieved in terms of accuracy. It is observed that RCNN has achieved an accuracy of 0.97 as compared to 0.92 accuracy of CNN at 20 epochs.

Forest ecosystems provide shelter for animals and birds, are responsible for climate stabilization, and provide food, water, wood, and herbal medicines etc. . Despite, all these benefits, forest fire has been a growing concern over the years. According to the recent wildfire statistics, there have been a total of 1065 large wildfires happened. The main 3 elements that playa major role in combustion are heat, oxygen, and fuel that is already present in abundant in the forest These three elements together are known as the fire triangle. When the temperature rises in the forest and there is less humidity and a windy breeze, there are maximum chances of fire taking place due to the tree barks and dry leaves which are the most combustible substances. By any chance, if the forest fire can be detected at its earlier stage, then it is possible for the forest officials to come up with a solution for its prevention and stopping any kind of massive destruction that may happen to the flora and fauna of the forest The forestry monitoring system designed by us mainly focuses not only on the day-to-day changes taking place in the forest, but also alerts the forest officials before the wildfire starts.","","978-1-6654-2149-2","10.1109/ICIDeA53933.2022.9970130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9970130","wildfire;IoT;NodeMCU;thingspeak;webpage","Image color analysis;Fires;Forestry;Vegetation;Humidity;Turning;Real-time systems","","2","","12","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Forest fires are a matter of concern in terms of economic growth and ecological damage and damage to animals and human life. Forest fires contribute to global warming and imbalances the climate on the earth making the lives harder. Early detection of forest fire can prevent the damage by a great extent. Sensor based and Image processing-based methods have been widely used followed by machine learning techniques to process the sensor data and detect the occurrence of forest fires. These methods are costly and difficult to install at different locations in the forest. As the dimensions of the forest area increases, the complexity of the system also increases. Deep Learning techniques such as variations of convolutional neural networks process image data and can provide an early warning about the occurrence of the fire. In the proposed system different pre trained deep neural network architectures such as Resnet 50, InceptionV3, GoogleNet, AlexNet, MobileNet have been employed using transfer learning approaches on two very important datasets namely Mendely dataset and Kaggle Datasets.

The existing systems for wildfire detection include video surveillance with high-end cameras using pattern recognition and satellite-based monitoring. These systems are very expensive which makes them beyond the reach of medium to small scale users. In a prior work, we proposed a low-power and low-cost wildfire monitoring system based on distributed sensor networks. The system combined a camera with humidity and smoke sensors. A major challenge in the implementation of that system was to classify the difference between camera images with and without the fire/smoke. The latest developments in deep learning offer a viable solution to process the camera images and detect the presence of wildfire/smoke using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use a very large wildfire image database to train and validate the CNN classifiers and analyze their classification accuracy. The results indicate that CNNs can detect presence of fire/smoke in wildfire images with very high accuracy.

Therefore, the identification of fire is necessary for the initial stages, until it spreads to wide areas and damages natural resources. Most of the previous systems devolved for detecting the fire, and have not been formally studied and verified. In this paper, a system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Unmanned Ariel Vehicles, is presented for detecting, verifying, and extinguishing forest fire. Different sensors are assumed in the subnet-based mechanism; sensors will detect the fire and send that information to the control room through gateways. UAV’s will be used to verify the fire information received from sensors and to extinguish the fire.

At present, there are three kinds of forest fire monitoring in China.One is the traditional observation tower, which has a large observation coverage and good effect. However, due to the limitation of terrain, it has some disadvantages, such as dead corner and blank;The second is video monitoring, but manual monitoring is easy to cause visual fatigue. The fire in the video is not easy to be detected, and the missing rate is very high. Third, the rapid development of VAV Remote Sensing Technology in recent years, but in practical application, a single VAV has small monitoring area, low load capacity and single returned data information, which can not meet the needs of practical application. Therefore, an unmanned detection system for forest fire prevention monitoring is designed in this project, which uses the ground-based observation platform intelligent cluster and VAV multi-sensor to complement each other, and according to the principles of image comparison, infrared detection and temperature detection, The ground air multi-agent cooperative control theory is adopted to realize fast and efficient forest fire image acquisition and forest inspection. While realizing the basic functions of VAV for forest fire monitoring, wind energy, solar energy and temperature difference energy are used to generate electricity, so as to improve the endurance time of VAV to a certain extent, so that VAV can cover a larger forest area. Further reduce the probability of forest fire. Combined with 5g communication technology and intelligent network technology, the formation and formation control strategy taking into account both search efficiency and traceability accuracy are formulated to realize the rapid positioning of fire points and timely and accurate feedback of forest fire information.","","978-1-7281-8115-8","10.1109/ICETCI55101.2022.9832311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832311","UAV;Energy saving;Forest fire prevention;Hybrid;Intelligent system;Image information acquisition","Intelligent networks;Visualization;Image recognition;5G mobile communication;Wind energy;Forestry;Communications technology","","10","","10","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The timely detection of wildfires plays a critical role in minimizing their detrimental impact. Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite equipped with an advanced Himawari imager (AHI) sensor, can provide full-disk data every 10 min, thus enabling near real-time and large-scale monitoring of wildfires. In this article, a wildfire detection method based on the spatiotemporal features of Himawari-8 data is proposed. First, a temporal convolutional network (TCN) is employed to predict the brightness temperature of the bands related to wildfire detection, achieving prediction results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.28 K, a mean square error (MSE) of 0.30 K2, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.10%. Then, various feature strategies are devised from spectral, spatial, and temporal aspects, and machine learning models are utilized for wildfire detection research. Among the considered strategies, strategy 4, which integrates spectral, spatial, and temporal features with the random forest (RF) algorithm, exhibits the most effective wildfire detection performance. It achieves a precision of 0.62, an omission of 0.34, and an F1-score of 0.64. Compared with the threshold method, precision increased by 0.05, omission decreased by 0.31, and F1-score increased by 0.21. To further evaluate practical applicability, the combination of strategy 4 and the RF is employed for wildfire detection near power grid transmission lines. In this scenario, out of the 295 real wildfires, 253 are successfully detected, resulting in a recall of 0.86. These experimental results affirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for wildfire detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3434434","Key Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province(grant numbers:202202AD080004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10613842","Brightness temperature prediction;Himawari-8 data;spatiotemporal features;temporal convolutional network (TCN);wildfire detection","Wildfires;Brightness temperature;Machine learning;Classification algorithms;Satellite broadcasting;Feature extraction;Clouds","","","","51","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we propose an approach for detecting early onset fires by leveraging equipment already deployed in existing power grid infrastructures, including those that cover remote areas. Our approach is based on the observation that radiated heat from fires quickly results in changes in transmission line temperatures and sag. As the transmission line temperature increase from radiated heat from a fire, the line also expands in length resulting in sag. By monitoring line temperatures and sag, we show that early onset wildfires (e.g. a 50 m2 wildfire) can be detected in less than a minute and up to 120m away from the transmission line.","2472-8152","978-1-7281-3103-0","10.1109/ISGT45199.2020.9087666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9087666","Wildfires;Heat Transfer;Early Fire Detection;Transmission Line Sag;Smart Grids","","","","","14","IEEE","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The processes that create ecosystems include forest fires, which have a profound impact on the distribution of plant species inside those ecosystems. Forest fires occur due to the increasing industrial emissions, which have also altered the global climate, and it is predicted that the temperature will rise in the coming years, creating a negative effect on the ecosystem. The socio-economic state of the environment and the general health of people will be significantly impacted by these developments. The incidence of more intense forest fires is the main cause for the increasing global temperature. To control the upcoming forest fires, new innovations and technology should be developed. This study reviews a variety of technologies that could be used in the entire range of forest fire warning systems that require more specifically needed administration, such as forest fire forecasting through forest conservation in fired areas. New technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence and 5G Networks are investigated to implement forest fire control. The efficient operation of upcoming forest fires is dependent on the modification of these technologies. Emerging innovations will play a major role in managing the upcoming forest fire accidents.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099572","Forest fire;Artificial intelligence;Internet of things;Wildlife","Technological innovation;5G mobile communication;Planets;Ecosystems;Forestry;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;Forecasting;Monitoring;Meteorology","","4","","12","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The earliest detection of a forest fire can reduce this significant damage and can help in many different ways in balancing the ecological cycle, The detection and response to forest fires can prevent them from spreading and causing more damage. In this project, we propose a forest fire detection system that responds to forest fires from a satellite view. We have used satellite images which plays a major role in the global defense system. It collects most of the data of the world. It helps in different preventive measures systems. We have used the multi spectral images of the earth’s surface view. That we have gathered from [1] Landsat-8 satellite. The images that we have collected have 11 channels rangingfrom{c1,c2,c3 ,c11}, and we have used three different constraints for image segmentation which use the reflectance and other conditions and thermal imaging to generate masks, then these masks are fed to the feed-forward network which is a U-Net architecture whose background is CNN. The three different constraints for image segmentation are Kumar-Roy, Schroeder, and Murphy conditions. We have not only stopped with a single U-Net model we have also used different U-Net architectures such as UNet 16F 3C,UNet 64F 3C, and UNet 64F 10C. These differences specify how many filters and channels that will be used for training the system. This trained model is inferred from the test images, which are split from the prior collected dataset. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can effectively detect forest fires with high accuracy.

Therefore, a fire detection system with dual sensor based wireless sensor network based with Sugeno FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) algorithm is designed that can be accessed through the Internet network. The purpose of this research is to create a forest fire monitoring system for a wide area of fire-prone areas using WSN (Wireless Sensor Network).

It may be averted if a comprehensive system is installed in forest regions to detect fires and inform firefighting authorities to take timely action. The goal of this project is to create an Internet of Things (IoT)-based real-time detection system that detects fires and sends emergency notices to authorities. A GSM/GPRS module interacts with an IoT server because network bandwidth is typically very poor or nonexistent in forest regions. As a result, a 2G network is ideal for communicating with the server. A real-time fire monitoring system that differentiates fire and smoke is used to identify an actual fire occurrence. The nano-based Atmega328 IoT gateway identifies the forest’s fire as soon as possible and acts rapidly before it spreads across a large area. Here, this uses machine learning algorithms to detect the event of a fire in a large region. The system uses a flame sensor to detect the flame and a temperature sensor to measure the temperature in a particular area. By using the machine learning method, the system can easily give the result with actual detection and intimate the authority about the temperature condition. The data are then sent to the cloud-based application. In the event of an unusual rise in forest temperature, this will alert the forest authorities and sound the fire alarm. It can also predict future fires by using machine learning. This is accomplished using the fog computing method. Due of the sensors’ efficiency, this might potentially be applied in industrial settings. Any type of forest can make use of it. From this experiment, this research study deduced that it has a remarkable accuracy of 98% in predicting forest fires.

However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3093625","Munich University of Applied Sciences and the German Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468971","Data fusion;deep learning;remote sensing;wildfire detection","Instruments;Satellites;Sensors;Remote sensing;Clouds;Earth;Satellite broadcasting","","82","","43","CCBY","30 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The role of the sensor network deployed in this scenario will consist in obtaining a representation (or a model) of the fire fronts, and distribute it to the firefighters in the area, in such a way they are aware of the risks they are assuming at each time. To achieve it, sensor nodes are able to determine their position, to detect the presence of fire (by monitoring the evolution of the ambient temperature), and to distribute this information wirelessly through the network. In this way, each firefighter maintains a fire representation consisting of a list of circles centered at the received positions. In this paper, we propose and analyze three criteria to assign the size of these circles. Simulation results show that a dynamic approach based on network density perceived by a node detecting fire offers an accurate approximation to the forest fire, without introducing a significant overhead.","1558-2612","978-1-4673-5939-9","10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555274","Wireless sensor networks;disaster management;phenomena monitoring;forest fire modeling","Fires;Shape;Approximation methods;Wireless sensor networks;Temperature sensors;Monitoring;Temperature measurement","","2","","27","IEEE","15 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The equipment that has completed camera calibration and binocular image correction uses the SGBM algorithm to perform binocular matching and obtain a disparity map. Then the three-dimensional transformation of coordinates can be completed to get the ranging result under the OpenCV environment. The system adopts ultraviolet sun-blind imaging monitoring technology to eliminate the interference of sunlight and utilizes SGBM algorithm, which has the advantages of fast processing speed and distinct processing effect. The obtained parallax map provides a reliable basis for binocular ranging; thus, it has a minor error.

Fires destroy several hectares of forest and leave behind ash, rendering it unfit for vegetation growth. Animal habitats are destroyed by the heat created by the fire. Preventing fire disasters and saving people’s lives and property requires early detection of fires before they become catastrophic. These forest fires must be detected and put out as early as possible. In this project a computer vision based deep learning model is proposed that can detect and alert in-case of forest fires. The model which is used here is called MobileNet Architecture which employs depth-wise separable convolutions and has greater advantages than using other currently existing models. The model is trained from a dataset that was scrapped from the internet. The computer vision model is built utilizing the packages in Python 3 such as NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow. This method is created by training and testing the model to identify failures and establish recovery strategies. As a result, these computer vision-based systems can provide a warning at an early stage of fire, which is critical for forest fire early warning.","","978-1-6654-7971-4","10.1109/ICESC54411.2022.9885250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885250","MobileNet Architecture;computer vision;Model Training and Validation;Optimization;Loss and Loss Function;Precision;Model Testing","Training;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Vegetation mapping;Forestry;Computer architecture","","5","","15","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many sensors for detecting the fire but it also has many demerits like expensive, requires large space for installation and other problems. Due to the emergence of a digital camera, detection of fire has become easier. The use of sensors has many limitations but it is resolved by using image processing techniques. Because certain things share characteristics with fire, making accurate forest fire detection algorithms difficult, false alert rates may be significant. In this study, we may examine several ways for detecting forest fires and provide a brand-new, four-stage video-based method for detecting forest fires using image processing. To find moving areas, a background-subtraction technique is used first. Secondly, RGB color space is used to identify possible fire zones. Third, because candidate zone might have moving fire-like things, extraction of characteristics is employed to differentiate between the actual fire as well as fire-like items.

Multiple wireless-based detection nodes (DNs) are distributed in high-risk areas of the forest to monitor the surrounding environment. The task of UAV is to circularly fly to them and collect the environmental data. Because of the kinematic constraints of UAV and the effective communication range between UAV and DN, this problem can be generally regarded as a Dubins traveling salesman problem with neighborhood (DTSPN). A bi-level hybridization-based metaheuristic algorithm (BLHMA) is proposed for solving this problem. At the first level, differential evolution (DE) optimizes the continuous-valued communication positions and UAV headings by the population-based search. For the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) corresponding to the combination of the positions and headings generated by DE, a constructive heuristic based on self-organized multi-agent competition (SOMAC) is proposed to determine the discrete collection sequence. By competitive iterations in such a cooperative way in DE, a high-quality data collection tour can be generated.

To estimate the locations of nodes in the network, a number of localization algorithms are developed which make use of techniques such as hop distances and centroid to estimate the positions of nodes. These algorithms showed sub-optimal results when tested in anisotropic fields with obstructions. In this work, a priority based localization algorithm is reported, which gives priority to a few reference nodes based on their Average Hop Distances (AHD).

In the simplest scenario, assuming the existence of an efficient dissemination layer, each network node obtains a representation of the forest fire starting from the complete list of positions reached by the fire so far. However, this approach makes an intensive use of node and network resources. In order to reduce these requirements, we propose incorporating in-network aggregation techniques. In particular, in this paper we analyze the employ of a shape composed of several convex hulls to represent the forest fire in a more compact way.

In this article, we propose a novel wildfire detection solution based on unmanned aerial vehicles assisted Internet of Things (UAV-IoT) networks. The main objective is to: 1) study the performance and reliability of the UAV-IoT networks for wildfire detection and 2) present a guideline to optimize the UAV-IoT network to improve fire detection probability under limited system cost budgets. We focus on optimizing the IoT devices’ density and the number of UAVs covering the forest area such that a lower bound on the wildfires detection probability is maximized within a limited time and system cost. At any time after the fire ignition, the IoT devices within a limited distance from the fire can detect it. These IoT devices can then report their measurements to nearby UAVs. Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) analysis is utilized to compute the fire detection and false-alarm probabilities. Numerical results suggest that given enough system cost, the UAV-IoT-based fire detection can offer a faster and more reliable wildfire detection solution than state-of-the-art satellite imaging techniques.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3077593","Center of Excellence for NEOM Research at KAUST; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424181","Disaster management;fire detection;IoT;Markov chain;UAV communication","Forestry;Reliability;Internet of Things;Satellite broadcasting;Wireless sensor networks;Satellites;Batteries","","100","","41","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Monitoring wildfire propagation is thus a vital task in mitigating forest fires. While computational model-based wildfire prediction methods provide reasonable accuracy in monitoring wildfire behavior, they are often limited due to the lack of constant availability of real-time meteorological data. In contrast, social-media-driven drone sensing (SDS) is emerging as a new sensing paradigm that detects the early signs of forest fires from online social media feeds and drives the drones for reliable sensing. However, due to the scarcity of social media data in remote regions and limited flight times of drones, SDS solutions often underperform in large-scale forest fires. In this paper, we present CompDrone, a wildfire monitoring framework that exploits the collective strengths of computational wildfire modeling and SDS for reliable wildfire monitoring. Two critical challenges exist to integrate computational modeling and SDS together: i) limited availability of social signals in the regions of a forest fire; and ii) predicting the regions of fire where the drones should be dispatched to. To solve the above challenges, the CompDrone framework leverages techniques from cellular automata, constrained optimization, and game theory. The evaluation results using a real-world wildfire dataset show that CompDrone outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in effectively predicting wildfire propagation.","2325-2944","978-1-7281-4351-4","10.1109/DCOSS49796.2020.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183707","social sensing;computational modeling;UAV;wildfire","Sensors;Computational modeling;Drones;Social network services;Monitoring;Forestry;Predictive models","","12","","42","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these disaster situations, the events being monitored have the potential to destroy the sensing devices, for example, they can be burnt in a fire, sunk in a flood, melted in volcano lava, short-circuited in harmful chemicals, etc. In this paper, a novel energy-efficient routing protocol called Maximise Unsafe Path (MUP) Routing using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is presented. The protocol aims to extend network lifetime by adapting the routes accordingly based on node destruction threat. MUP uses a routing technique that maximises the energy utilisation of nodes that are going to fail sooner, in order to save the energy of the other nodes. MUP is implemented as an extension to the RPL protocol for IPv6-based WSNs.

This study aims to predict the probability of forest fires based on three key environmental factors: humidity, oxygen levels, and temperature. By analyzing the relationship between these factors and the likelihood of forest fires, this study hopes to provide valuable insights for forest management and fire prevention strategies. The proposed approach uses these factors to create a predictive model to identify areas at high risk for forest fires and provide early warning, thereby reducing the risk of forest fires and their negative impacts on the environment and communities. Those areas can make use of this model to predict the probability of forest fire occurrence based on the temperature, humidity and oxygen level of the current weather detected in the risky regions. Finally, the system has the potential to be scalable and can be adapted to different types of forests and environmental conditions, making it a versatile tool for forest fire management.

YOLO and Feedforward ResNet are sophisticated deep learning models that are used with the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol within a wireless sensor network (WSN). By using the dispersed sensor nodes of the WSN, LEACH optimizes energy use and assigns cluster heads for effective data reporting. A real-time object detection system called YOLO analyses pictures taken by cameras that are positioned in key places to recognize fires and smoke. YOLO is enhanced by ResNet's effectiveness. In this configuration, data is transmitted from sensor nodes to cluster heads, who then pass it on to a central station for in-the-moment processing. As soon as a forest fire is discovered, alarms are immediately transmitted to the relevant authorities. The system's efficacy is confirmed through deployments in the actual world and simulations, which minimize false positives.

In this study, we will discuss the structure of a “Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)” and a data-gathering technique for FF detection in actual environments. The energy efficiency is crucial due to the “Sensor Node (SN)” constrained processing capability and minimum power battery. Extensive study is required to address these concerns. The SNs must be placed as closely together as feasible so that the whole forest can be monitored. Such an implementation strategy produces a crowded network environment in which SNs' coverage could intersect. To achieve the coverage goal, the basic requirement is to activate all SNs following installation. Together all SNs inside these overlapping areas are left “ON” which will reduce the lifespan of the network. Some of the SNs were put into an “Active-State (AS)” whereas others are left in a “Sleep-State (SS)” strategy that may be used to prolong the network's lifespan and preserve its coverage. Our study proposes a new protocol called the “Dynamic Optimized Time Scheduler (DOTS)” based on clustering to deal with the network lifespan problem from two angles. At first, the “Enhanced Sleeping Scheduler (ESS)” method is used to keep a small group of SNs in AS to guard the target while the rest of the SNs in the SS. The next will be for SNs to occasionally share the data they've collected locally with one another. The primary use of this concept is to update receivers only after an update has taken place. We examine the “Energy Efficiency”, “Packet Delivery Ratio”, “Throughput”, and “Routing Overhead” of the proposed DOTS protocol in comparison to the “Clustering-based Compression-Aggregation (CCA)” and the “Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA)” existing protocols in the WSN.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060020","Forest Fire;Wireless Sensor Networks;Energy Efficiency;Clustering;Scheduling","Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Clustering algorithms;Forestry;Spread spectrum communication;US Department of Transportation;Throughput","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this research proposes the development of a LoRa (Long Range) based forest fire monitoring system combined with AES-256 and SHA-256. This system aims to provide fast, accurate, and secure early warning against forest fires. In this system, a distributed network of sensors in the forest area is used to collect real-time forest fire data and send it to the central station through LoRa technology. In addition, the AES-256 is applied to maintain the security of sensitive information, such as the location of fires, so authorized parties can only access it. SHA-256 is used to maintain data integrity and availability of data. The use of LoRa, AES-256, and SHA-256 is expected to protect this system from eavesdropping attacks and ensure secure communication. With this system, it is expected that the risk of forest fires can be minimized, responses to fires can be carried out more quickly and effectively, and the necessary information can be provided to the authorities in forest fire management in the Kalimantan region.

Also, the presented method was able to detect the fault type, and compute its released energy that can contribute to wildfire based on the measured voltages and currents of the distribution nodes.

The primary threat is forest fires, which have disastrous repercussions. As a result, it is critical to identify and extinguish a fire before it spreads and destroys resources. To that end, we propose a forest fire detection and fighting mechanism using wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs). Temperature sensors are utilized to detect fires, and actors (robots) are employed to extinguish them. Sensors and robots are distributed at random throughout the forest, forming clusters. Clustering, sleep/active scheduling for the sensors, and energy harvesting (EH)/moving modes for the robots, are used to extend and maximize the sensors/robots lifetime in the WSAN. In such a network, robots should move to the fire site as quickly as possible. To do this, we further propose a robot routing mechanism that focuses on determining the shortest path for each firefighting robot. In particular, each firefighting robot equipped with on-board processing uses a fuzzy  $Q$ -learning (FQL)-based trajectory mechanism to learn the shortest path to the fire zone in the least amount of time. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of employing the proposed framework for rapid and effective fire response.

Different from previous researches which focus mostly on plane or single slope, this work deals with the scenarios of unsmooth moutainous land, which are the majority of application situations in forest fire prevention. The layout of wireless sensor nodes in the complex forest slope is a typical NP-complete problem. Another difficulty is that varied terrain factors bring huge obstacles for calculating the fitness value of optimization algorithm. To overcome these difficulties, firstly, this paper provides a computing method of fitness value, based on fire-response time on the simulated forest land. Secondly, we analyze the defects on parameter adjustment of original NMCSA (Novel Modified Cuckoo Search Algorithm), and improve it in two aspects: (1) cutting down the step-size factor errors by using mean operator and (2) redefining the updating method of discarding probability. The simulated experiments indicate that the improved NMCSA outperforms the previous algorithms in convergence speed and accuracy. What's more, the averaged response time of the generated layout by the new method is shorter.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855473","wireless sensor network;mountainous forest land;Cuckoo search;spatial layout optimization","Layout;Forestry;Optimization;Monitoring;Heuristic algorithms;Birds;Convergence","","","","32","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensor nodes are often deployed through random spreading, and function in dynamic environments. Many applications of WSNs such as pollution tracking, forest fire detection, and military surveillance require knowledge of the location of constituent nodes. But the use of technologies such as GPS on all nodes is prohibitive due to power and cost constraints. So, the sensor nodes need to autonomously determine their locations. Most localization techniques use anchor nodes with known locations to determine the position of remaining nodes. Localization techniques have two conflicting requirements. On one hand, an ideal localization technique should be computationally simple and on the other hand, it must be resistant to attacks that compromise anchor nodes. In this paper, we propose a computationally light-weight game theoretic secure localization technique and demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing techniques.","","978-1-4799-5154-3","10.1109/IOT.2014.7030120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030120","","Wireless sensor networks;Robot sensing systems;Internet of things;Maximum likelihood estimation;Games;Convergence;Computational complexity","","6","","32","IEEE","5 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, to handle certain applications such as forest fire investigation or nuclear radiation leakage mapping where the density information for the events of interest is not known to the MSN, an adaptive law is presented so that the event density approximation of each sensor converges to the real one along its trajectory.

The indices are based on satellite measurements and they have been built using the hyperspectral infrared sensor IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interfemoter) flying onboard the European Meteorological Platforms (MetOp). With the IASI instrument, we can retrieve simultaneously the surface emissivity and temperature, and thermo-dynamical parameters of air, such as temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profiles. Infrared surface emissivity (ε) is more closely related to surface type and coverage concerning the commonly used normalized differential vegetation index (or NDVI). By properly using surface emissivity in the infrared we defined a set of channels that are particularly sensitive to bare soil, green and senescent vegetation. IASI capability to sense the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere enables to retrieve both surface temperature (Ts) and dew point temperature (Td) close to the surface. The difference between these two quantities (Ts-Ts) is a direct measure of the hydric stress at the surface. Emissivity indices complemented with the last one, obtained from the same measurements, enable the individuating region to be subject to a risk of drought, hence and forest fire, and allow us to overcome the problem of lacking space and temporal consistency.

Forest fire, landslide or intrusion detection are some examples. In order to perform anomaly detection, wireless sensors are deployed in the area of interest and the nodes monitor a physical parameter. If this parameter exceeds a predefined threshold, the node generates an alarm and sends it in direction of the collection point (the sink). In some cases, the anomaly can span over several nodes, so each of the nodes produces one alarm, resulting in several alarms sent for the same event. These alarms are produced and sent in a very short amount of time, this phenomenon is called alarm storm and causes network congestion, collisions and increases the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a mechanism which allows to reduce the number of redundant alarms. The proposed mechanism consists in a competition among nodes sensing the anomaly, which aims at determining the node which is the better located to actually send the alarm. The proposed mechanism is evaluated by extensive simulations, the results show that the scheme is able to reduce drastically the number of redundant alarms while not interfering on the MAC and routing processes which guarantee timeliness and reliability to anomaly detection applications.","2166-9589","978-1-4799-4912-0","10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7136365","","Wireless sensor networks;Delays;Storms;Energy consumption;Synchronization;Protocols;Monitoring","","1","","15","IEEE","29 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, despite the growing number of applications (e.g., Forest fire detection, wildlife monitoring), the deployment challenges posed by the real-world natural environment still hinder the widespread adoption of this technology. In particular, the unpredictability of the low-power wireless channel in the presence of vegetation requires costly trial-and-error pilot campaigns to understand where and how to place the wireless nodes. In this paper, we propose a technique based on remote sensing for accurately estimating low-power radio signal attenuation in forest environments. We leverage airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instruments and related automatic data analysis systems to determine local forest attributes (e.g., Tree density) that, once factored into a specialized radio path loss model, enable accurate estimation of the received signal power. Our approach is i) automatic, i.e., It does not require in-field campaigns, and ii) fine-grained, i.e., It enables per-link estimates. Our validation from deployments in a real forest shows that the error of our per-link estimates of the received signal power is around ± 6 dBm - the accuracy of RSSI readings from the radio transceiver.","2325-2944","978-1-4799-8856-3","10.1109/DCOSS.2015.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165025","low-power wireless communication;wireless sensor networks;remote sensing;LiDAR;IEEE 802.15.4","Vegetation;Laser radar;Wireless sensor networks;Vegetation mapping;Wireless communication;Estimation;Attenuation","","9","","32","IEEE","23 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An optical design and implementation based on flame pyroelectric sensor are present in this paper. Two types of directional flame detection are provided. One is to achieve plane-type directional detection, and the other is to achieve line-type directional detection. For plane-type directional detection, the optical viewing angle design of detection device in the horizontal and vertical direction is asymmetric. The viewing angle of vertical direction is much bigger than that of horizontal direction in order to detect the flame anywhere in vertical plane as far as possible. On the other hand, the viewing angle of horizontal direction is expected to be smaller so as to ensure directional flame detection. The size of viewing angle is controlled within a certain range through a special optical design including lens and slit. The design of line-type directional detection is achieved based on ultra-small viewing angle of the lens. Based on such design of flame detectors, the detection range can be adjusted by changing the optical parameters, so long-distance flame detection can be achieved. This scheme has a broad application prospects in many fields, such as forest fire prevention, automatic fire cannons, etc., because of directional flame detection. Experiments show that this method has achieved the expected results.","","978-1-4244-6585-9","10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5658848","flame detection;directional detection;long distance;optical design","Fires;Optical sensors;Variable speed drives;Lenses","","","","10","IEEE","6 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sufficient training data are collected in the form of empirical evidence, which have labeled positive and negative samples to build the hypothesis. The hypothesis is constructed by the conjunction of the attributes, which can be learnt by machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we work with two forms of ranking weights, precision and relevance, which help in finding hidden patterns and prediction future events. Empirical evidence for a weather patterns and tracking of a phenomenon needs to accurately extract the attributes and label the training samples, which is a very laborious and time-consuming effort. Automating weather prediction algorithms, which are trained by supervised learning, needs to be generalized so that it can be tested with unreliable and noisy weather data from low cost sensors. We use a training data from previous forest fires events, the datasets containing all the attributes are labeled using manual data logs for a given geographical area. The labeled original dataset is mapped to the data collected from on-line sensors, which further improves the accuracy of the training set. As some of classes have very few samples, which are related to the peak fire seasons, domain specific knowledge are added by sensor measurements and Fire Weather Index (FWI) to help accurately model the events. We show that training accuracy of the small forest fire classifier using attributes from manual logs is enhanced by 30% by using sensor data. The rare and hard to classify large forest fires are 95% accurately classified by using the new Fire Weather Index (FWI). We also show that our framework is more robust to outliers from noisy sensor measurements by accounting for in the model parameters. The model allows further generalization for linearly and non-linearly separable datasets by estimating the parameters (1-δ) and minimum allowable error ϵ for hypothesis, sampling accuracy and cross validation.","2375-9259","978-1-4673-0005-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137355","Sampling sensors;Dataming;Machine Learning;Ranking functions;IR;Event Modeling;Forest fires;FWI;Temporal Patterns;Sensor Networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization;Meteorology;Mathematical model;Accuracy;Indexes;Barium","","1","","20","IEEE","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks.

The recent fire incident in Australia has highlighted the need of detecting forest fire in its initial stages. Poaching has a huge imbalance in the ecosystem, due to poaching many endangered species are now on the brink of extinction. A framework of IoT based Anti-poaching and Fire alarm System (IAFS) designed in this paper comprises of three sensors, i.e., temperature sensor, smoke sensor and Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) sensor. The proposed IoT based IAFS device consists of Arduino board which collects all the data from these sensors and relays the information to the cloud. The cloud platform continuously monitors the data and sends an alert notification via SMS to the forest officials whenever there is any intrusion detected. The aim of this proposed IAFS is to be able to remotely monitor forest cover and poaching of wild animals. Even with all the addition of extra manpower to curb the poaching activities and safeguard the forest, it is still inefficient owing to the large and dense forest area. The proposed IAFS enables forest officials to monitor the forest area and collect data of any intrusion remotely.","","978-1-6654-3888-9","10.1109/MysuruCon52639.2021.9641539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641539","Anti-poaching;Sensors;IAFS;IoT;Intrusion;Fire Alarm System;Arduino","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Resistors;Cloud computing;Animals;Forestry;Alarm systems","","10","","15","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose and evaluate two algorithms, based on information fusion methods, for fire detection in rainforests when we have only light and temperature sensors. The idea is to have acceptable detection methods even when we do not have (or cannot afford) other sensor units that would lead to more accurate inferences, such as humidity sensors, smoke detectors or video cameras. In this sense, we collect and analyze real environmental data in situations that are similar to those found in real scenarios. Then, we create some controlled fire (events) of small proportion, close to sensor nodes, to force event occurrences. Experimental results indicate that forest fire can be detected at night by using just light measurements. In addition, light data can be used to distinguish heat resulting from sunbeam and fire. The first method is based on the moving average filter and thresholds (Threshold method), while the second uses the moving average filter and the Dempster-Shafer theory. Both methods present similar results regarding the detection efficacy considering the generated instances. However, the Threshold method is more stable, due to the use of state machine to represent the environment conditions.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7755-5","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546519","","Temperature measurement;Current measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Size measurement;Temperature distribution;Monitoring","","14","","11","IEEE","12 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fires result in distinct and characteristic signatures on all remote sensing imagery. The large proportion of total area burned in boreal forests occurs in large fire events-the majority of area burned occurs in fires greater than 10,000 ha in size. These fires result in signatures which are not only spatially heterogeneous, but also have distinct temporal signatures. The authors present the results of a study which investigated the use of a variety of systems to monitor the effects of fire on remote sensing data collected over a large (40,000 ha) forest fire near Tok, Alaska. This fire occurred during the summer of 1991. Visible and near-IR region (AVHRR, SPOT) as well the microwave region (the ERS-1 and JERS-1 SARs) observations were made. The studies have shown that in the visible and near-IR data sets, the remotely-sensed signatures result from variations in the levels of burn intensity and patterns of vegetation regrowth. These patterns can clearly being interpreted through examination of vegetation indices derived from the AVHRR and SPOT data sets. On the other hand, the analyses of the microwave imagery collected by the ERS-1 SAR show that the spatial patterns of radar backscatter are primarily due to variations in surface roughness due to variations in burn intensity as well as variations in soil moisture, while the temporal patterns of radar backscatter are due to seasonal variations in soil moisture. The authors present examples of the remotely-sensed data sets along with ground-truth measurements which illustrate the sources of variations observed in the satellite imagery.<>","","0-7803-2402-1","10.1109/COMEAS.1995.472396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=472396","","Fires;Remote sensing;Remote monitoring;Vegetation mapping;Radar imaging;Spaceborne radar;Backscatter;Soil moisture;Environmental factors;Image analysis","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Solutions for the problem are still in their initial phase. The nodes may be dropped from the airplane or thrown manually to non-optimally cover the sensing area. Our aim is to optimally deploy, the randomly deployed movable nodes. The previous researches targeted the area coverage based on GPS locations alone, but due to complex geography and obstacles in wireless transmission the network may remain disconnected and crucial applications like forest fire detection may not be sensed deterministically. We use an adaptive signal strength equalization method to ensure connection between any two adjacent nodes. We argue that the resultant geometry of node clusters should be hexagonal in shape where the center node is equidistant from all the vertices and these vertices shall be common to nearby clusters. But geographic hexagons do not ensure proper signal due to obstacles in line-of-sight and signal strength may not be deterministic leading to network disconnection. We propose to create hexagonal geometry based on signal strength instead of distance alone. Our scheme ensures no network disconnections and coverage of whole geographic area which is of utmost priority. Once the complete deployment takes place all the hexagonal clusters have equal average signal strength.","","978-1-5386-2663-4","10.1109/SCEECS.2018.8546990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8546990","wireless sensor network;optimal deployment;clustering;movable nodes","Wireless sensor networks;Robot sensing systems;Global Positioning System;Forestry;Wireless communication;Fires","","1","","14","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Comparatively, old methods like scare crows are not as effective as before, as the intruders realize the tactics relatively. Also, the other problems faced are forest fires destroying crops and withering of crops due to insufficient irrigation. Hence, in this work a new innovative method is adapted which protects the crops precisely. This work aims at developing a rotatory device that detects and identifies any real time moving object in its jurisdiction. This work also aims at developing a system that detects forest fires and conveys the same to the farmer instantly; and a system that irrigates the crops automatically upon requirement. On effective implementation, this work increases crop yield. It also contributes to factors like reduction in hunger overall and prevention of farmers' suicide. As a measure of cost effectiveness, the device is miniaturized to an extent where the ultrasonic sensor detects various movements in a 30 cm radius and triggers the servo motor and the sprinkler. Upon being triggered, the servo motor helps the device rotate accordingly to 180° angle. Simultaneously, the sprinkler sprinkles the water onto the detected intruder, which accounts for driving them away. The flame sensor for forest fire detection and the moisture sensor for automatic irrigation also work simultaneously. The precision and accuracy of the device will be enhanced in the future course according to the requirements.","","979-8-3503-4729-6","10.1109/ICSSES58299.2023.10200710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10200710","Intruder;sensors;crop protection;irrigation;sprinkler","Irrigation;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Soil moisture;Crops;Fires;Forestry;Real-time systems","","","","7","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inexistence of a fully-operational EO space segment dedicated to these tasks leads to the development of near-operational systems based on current existing technology and trying to conceive new ways of improving results. In this paper, the overall architecture of such a system is presented, compiling the experience acquired in the several aspects of the problem and presenting an integral and comprehensive solution. The system architecture comprises three well-defined parts: the EO reception facilities, the service provider centre(s), and the decision support systems (DSS). The EO data acquisition facilities receive data from sensors whose usefulness for forest fire management has been proved through several demonstrations and studies. This is the case of the MODIS sensor onboard TERRA and AQUA satellites, the AVHRR in NOAA, the CAVHRR in FENG-YUN, and the recent SEVIRI sensor onboard MSG. Future space segments would be incorporated to the system in a progressive manner, leading it into a more operational stage. The service provider centres are conceived as the facilities that ingest EO data from the reception stations along with non-space data, process the information with a set of scientific tools and algorithms (Toolbox), and generate the value-added products directly usable by end-user organizations under an operational scenario. The resulting fire products are then stored in the centre and disseminated to users according to their needs. A near-operational system for forest fire management has to be tailored trying to meet the exact needs of each type of users, focusing specially on real-time requirements. Therefore, this system cannot be either a mere product generator to be accessed by the users or a ""just product-oriented"" supplier. The only solution to achieve the proposed objectives is to wrap the generated products around a customized and committed service envelope delivered at the user-end. This is the mission of the Decision Support Systems (DSS) installed at user premises, which are an essential tool to achieve operational fire information services using satellite data.","","0-7803-8977-8","10.1109/RAST.2005.1512549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512549","","Fires;Decision support systems;Satellites;Space technology;Data acquisition;MODIS;Risk management;Sensor systems;Remote sensing;Service oriented architecture","","2","","4","IEEE","3 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The UAVs of the disaster management system take images and sensor data (e.g., temperature and humidity data) of the areas where the disasters can occur, and then the disaster management system stitches the images of the areas to monitors the areas. This paper proposes the low-power image stitching management (LPISM) that can reduce power consumptions of the UAVs that take images for image stitching in the disaster management system. The disaster management system with the LPISM generates the least number of waypoints for the UAV to take images for image stitching. Therefore, the UAVs can reduce power consumption for taking images, and the UAV can increase the frequency of gathering sensor data for monitoring disasters in detail. The gathered sensor data can be used for multi-modal data convergence analysis in order to respond dangerous situations.","2158-4001","978-1-5386-3025-9","10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326248","","Disaster management;Cameras;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Power demand;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement","","4","","8","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research and efforts to prevent forest fires with early detection systems have become the main focus lately. Early detection of forest fires requires real-time and accurate performance to extinguish the fire immediately. An accurate Artificial Intelligence method for detection is using deep learning. However, the drawback of deep learning is the long inference process due to the large size of the model. The dataset that we use in this research consists of two classes: the fire class and the non-fire class. In this research, we propose using quantization to shrink deep learning models. We use quantization to convert floating point 32-bit to 16-bit. The deep learning model that we use is the CNN DenseNet-121 model. The quantization results on the deep learning model show that the values for macro precision, macro recall, macro F1, and accuracy have not changed from the original deep learning, namely 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99. The size of the deep learning model has decreased from 28.2 MB to 13.7 MB. It affects the inference model time, which is 36 times faster using quantization of deep learning than the original deep learning model. The speed of inference model quantization reaches 0.062 s per image. Through these results, the quantization result in the deep learning model can run in real-time and accurately.","","979-8-3503-0686-6","10.1109/EECSI59885.2023.10295606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10295606","Deep learning;DenseNet-121;Forest fire;Quantization;Real-time","Deep learning;Electrical engineering;Computer science;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Ecosystems;Forestry","","","","31","IEEE","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These events are very hard to predict and are out of human control. Much like them, wildfires can be devastating and can lead to significant destructions, but fortunately they can be detected, controlled and prevented from spreading. The evolution of the wildfire detection and prevention technologies is long. The traditional methods rely on human involvement and include the use of manned fire watchtowers and piloted fire observation aircrafts. These solutions are very effective, but they are also very costly and sometimes can be extremely dangerous. With the technological advancements in the different engineering areas, safer and cheaper solutions for early forest fire detection were slowly developed - fire detection satellites, fire and lightning detectors, wireless sensor networks, as well as static optical or thermal cameras. Nevertheless, all of these solutions have disadvantages, which calls for their constant improvement, as well as for the development of more advanced and reliable systems. In this paper we present our experience in the area of the systems for early forest fire and smoke detection. Following the introduction section, we analyse in details an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to real-time automatic smoke detection, which is suitable for use in camera-based static forest observation systems and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Proper methods should be adapted to reduce the risks. In any case of wildfire, the reaction should be fast and handled tactically, to extinguish the root sources of fire in their initial stages before they can convert into a wildfire.

To calculate the fire hazard assessment, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system (HFIS) has been implemented, which aggregates a set of input parameters characterizing the state of a forest area into a single assessment. When forming this assessment, parameters are taken into account that characterize the state of the climate, the presence of dry trees, the characteristics of the state of combustible materials located on the surface of the earth, as well as the state of peat. The implementation of the computing platform is carried out using a set of Arduino controllers. To test the functionality of the proposed computing complex, its model was implemented in the TinkerCAD simulation environment. Also, using the Python programming language, a similar HFIS was implemented in the form of an independent model. As a result of comparing these two computing complexes, it has been shown that they generate similar results. This fact confirms the possibility of using several Arduino controllers to implement a computing platform based on a HFIS. The proposed provisions are aimed at expanding the IoT networks to build monitoring systems for forests and other natural areas.","","979-8-3315-0502-8","10.1109/SED63331.2024.10741064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10741064","computing platform;controller;hierarchical fuzzy inference system;Internet of Things;forest monitoring;fire hazard assessment","Fuzzy logic;Computational modeling;Forestry;Hazards;Software;Sensor systems;Telecommunications;Sensors;Internet of Things;Monitoring","","","","16","IEEE","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sweep coverage is an important concern of WSNs that more targets in the area can be monitored with fewer mobile sensor nodes. With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV has been increasingly used in military and civil fields. UAVs can be regarded as sensor nodes to perform specific tasks. Due to the limited battery lifetime of UAV in flight mission, it is difficult to achieve full coverage of all targets in a large-scale monitoring scenario. In this article, we study how to plan the paths of multiple UAVs for sweep coverage. Based on the background of forest fire early warning and monitoring, we consider a min-time max-coverage (MTMC) issue in sweep coverage, where a set of UAVs is dispatched to efficiently patrol the targets in the given area to achieve maximum coverage in minimum time. We establish a mathematical model considering the different coverage quality requirements of the targets in the given area. Then, we analyze the characteristics of the model and propose a heuristic algorithm weighted targets sweep coverage (WTSC) to find the optimal path, which considers the weights of the targets and the performance constraints of UAVs. Finally, we provide various numerical experiments and comparisons with several previous works to validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2999083","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873249,61976197); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2015CFA010); 111 Project(grant numbers:B17040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9105056","Path planning;sweep coverage;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);weighted targets sweep coverage (WTSC) algorithm","Path planning;Task analysis;Forestry;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","","91","","35","IEEE","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such definition implies the capacity of a DSS of analysing and processing data generated or communicated by multiple sources. A DSS developed to help a civil protection or a fire service Authority should be fed by data and information provided not only by the citizens to emergency numbers, but also from any other organisation involved in the rescue process as well as by available sensors networks, from simulation tools using such data and from the wealth of information provided by GIS data services. Experiences gathered in the course of recent emergencies involving either large areas or very high numbers of people have shown that, even in recent years, the coordination of rescue activities rarely, if not never, was able to take advantage from ICT tools. The main obstacles to data exchange are political attitudes and lack of interoperability services. As a consequence, whenever an uncommon scenario demands such data exchange, the resulting political pressure brings to either exchange data anyway, through improper (and potentially risky) means, or to avoid such data exchange (and miss the related advantages). The sole possibility to overcome such situation is to reach an agreement between the different authorities, aimed at converting and exchanging data in a common protocol, which can be read by non homogeneous systems. Such solution has been tested in Italy in several real-life situations: L'Aquila earthquake (2009), summer forest fire season (2009), Venice local emergency management (2008 - today) and in several well aimed exercises in Europe and U.S.A.","2472-8586","978-1-5090-1841-3","10.1109/ICAICT.2016.7991738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991738","Interoperability;CAP;Emergency management","Fires;Interoperability;Emergency services;Europe;Protocols;Standards;Real-time systems","","","","10","IEEE","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hierarchical Routing Protocol (HRP) in WSN rotates different responsibilities among nodes with an aim to preserve energy. In this paper we propose a new HRP coined as FCM-ACO for WSN. The deployed nodes are partitioned into fixed clusters by the base station (BS) using Fuzzy C Means (FCM). The cluster heads (CH's) are locally selected from clusters based on residual energy and proximity to BS. Data flows from non cluster head nodes (non-CH) to their respective CH and is aggregated by the latter. An upper chain consisting of the CH's is constructed by BS using ant colony optimization (ACO) along with the selection of a super leader (SL). Data flows along the upper chain being fused at every node except the terminal ones to the SL which transmits directly to BS. We have done extensive Matlab simulations and results indicate FCM-ACO extends WSN lifetime in comparison to LEACH, LEACH-C, PEGASIS and DFCP.

Accurate source localization enables the elimination of the rotor core in atrial fibrillation (AFib) as an effective treatment for such severe cardiac disorder; it also finds potential use in locating the spreading source in natural disasters such as forest fires and tsunamis. However, existing approaches such as time of arrival (TOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) do not yield accurate localization results since they tacitly assume a constant signal propagation speed whereas realistic propagation is often nonstatic and heterogeneous. In this article, we develop a nonlinear TDOA (NTDOA) approach that utilizes observational data from various positions to jointly learn the propagation speed at different angles and distances as well as the location of the source itself. Through examples of simulating the complex dynamics of electrical signals along the surface of the heart and satellite imagery from forest fires and tsunamis, we show that with a small handful of measurements, NTDOA, as a data-driven approach, can successfully locate the spreading source, leading also to better forecasting of the speed and direction of subsequent propagation.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3443655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10643792","Atrial fibrillation (AFib);forest fire;localization;nonlinearity;rotors;time difference of arrival (TDOA);tsunami","Location awareness;Sensors;Tsunami;Forestry;Media;Computational modeling;Mathematical models","","","","42","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The OMS-DFC framework consists of two stages, viz., the target identification stage without communication between UAVs and the mitigation stage with restricted communication. In the first stage, each UAV adapts proposed OMS with three levels to select between Levy flight, Brownian search, and directionally driven Brownian (DDB) search for accurate target identification (“fire location”). The selection of each level is based on the available sensor information about the possible fire location. In the second stage, the UAVs that identified a fire location fly in a dynamic formation to quench the fire using water. The proposed formation is achieved through decentralized control, where a UAV computes the control action based on the fire profile and also the angular position and angular separation with its succeeding neighbor. The proposed formation control law guarantees asymptotic convergence to the desired time-varying angular position profile of UAVs based on the nature of fire spread (circular/elliptical). To evaluate the performance of the proposed OMS-DFC for the multi-UAV system, a search and fire quenching mission in a typical pine forest is simulated. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to evaluate the average performance of the proposed OMS-DFC-based multi-UAV mission, and the results clearly highlight the advantages of the proposed OMS-DFC in forest firefighting. Note to Practitioners—Searching and mitigating dynamic targets like the forest fire is a challenging task due to the large area involved and also the time-varying nature of fire spread. The use of a cooperative multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for searching targets in large area poses difficulties in maintaining persistent long distance communication between them. Moreover, the elliptical fire profile demands a time-varying angular displacement formation control of UAVs for effective fire mitigation. In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for search and mitigation of forest fire. The first stage provides a decentralized, noniterative stochastic search algorithm that requires no information sharing between the UAVs. The proposed search algorithm can be implemented without much computational efforts using a temperature measuring sensor and a thermal imaging sensor. The second stage provides a decentralized time-varying angular displacement formation control law efficient for tracking elliptical targets. The formation control law only assumes the availability of restricted UAV communication. The proposed formation control law can handle any targets that demand time-varying angular displacement formation for UAVs. The proposed algorithm is suitable for multi-UAV missions involving search and mitigation of dynamic targets distributed over a large area.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2018.2867614","ST-Engineering NTU Corporate Laboratory(grant numbers:CRP3-P2P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8474373","Decentralized search;forest firefighting;formation control;multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system;Oxyrrhis Marina-inspired search (OMS)","Forestry;Heuristic algorithms;Temperature measurement;Vehicle dynamics;Target tracking;Task analysis;Fuels","","130","","39","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early recognition and detection of forest fires is a very challenging problem. Numerous potential sources of error leads to an increased rate of false positives (false alarms). The proposed system addresses them by exploiting the complementarities between thermal and optical cameras located at a panoramic static ground location together with the same type of cameras mounted onboard a (or potentially more) UAS.

A MATLAB simulation script has been developed for this research. Packet forwarding employs geographic routing based on progress towards destination. The simulator considers a realistic channel with a log normal shadowing model. Neighbor detection is performed by calculating the received signal power and the SNR. The studied topologies are Uniform Deterministic (Grid), Uniform Random (Constant Placement), Simple Diffusion (Gaussian), Pareto, Stensor and StensorX. The network performance is analyzed with respect to packet delivery ratio, average number of hops per packet, delay and energy consumption caused by MAC retrials. Routing failures are analyzed as well as their possible causes. Simulations are run for various network densities in a reasonable forest sized area and show which topology performs better with geographic routing in the particular scenario presented here.","","978-1-4577-1878-6","10.1109/Swe-CTW.2011.6082480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6082480","network toplogies;node distributions;geographic routing;performance study;node placement;node topologies","Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Network topology;Fires;Delay;Sensors;Topology","","2","","12","IEEE","17 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So it's crucial to forecast forest fires. Nowadays, a lot of methods for predicting forest fires are based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. By delivering solutions to numerous crises, like forest fires, ML is assisting the planet. In this work, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network with Adaptive Variability Functionality (RBFNN-AVF) was proposed. To anticipate forest fires in images, the ML method RBFNN-AVF is used in this work. Building a model for early wildfire identification and aiding in damage management due to such occurrences are the goals of employing such a system. There are several approaches to finding forest fires, including sensor detection and real-time geological data processing. However, utilizing picture classification, where ML is the most efficient method, is one of the greatest techniques to detect fire. ML techniques allow for the addition of these response systems or the configuration of drones with them, allowing for the frequent taking of pictures from the sky, the detection of smoke in dense forests, and the prompt notification of the appropriate authorities. Using the RBFNN-AVF approach, \ fire detection is carried out using the suggested model, and the results were successful in terms of accuracy. Therefore, using a model based on ML to handle calamitous scenarios may be an option. Out of all of these classification models, RBFNN-AVF had the highest precision of 96.9%. According to the results, it is possible to predict a wildfire's size before it even starts by analyzing climate data.","","979-8-3503-0088-8","10.1109/ICOSEC58147.2023.10276328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10276328","Classification;Climatic Changes;Severe Heat Waves;Forest fires;Wildfires;Wind Pattern","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Planets;Biological system modeling;Weather forecasting;Forestry;Radial basis function networks","","","","15","IEEE","16 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose the SimConnector Emulator, a novel approach for the testing of real-world systems using agent-based simulations as a means of validation. The basic idea is to use agent-based simulations to generate event data to allow the testing of responses of the software system to real-time events.

The proposed system utilizes IoT-enabled sensor networks to gather real-time data on temperature, humidity, air quality, and sound, providing extensive coverage of forested areas. The collected data is processed using AI algorithms, including Deep Learning with Decision Trees and Time Series Analysis (DL-DT-TSA), to identify patterns and anomalies associated with forest fire risks, illegal logging incidents, and climate change indicators. Through extensive simulation analysis, the DL-DT-TSA algorithm is compared with existing algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The results demonstrate that the DL-DT-TSA algorithm outperforms the other algorithms, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting and alerting relevant authorities and stakeholders about potential threats in real-time.

Fire cases that often occur require a system that is able to detect fires and provide information to users remotely to reduce the impact of fires. Along with the development of hardware technology such as computers, the use of GIS seems to be an effective shortcut in analyzing an event. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized application workloads, offering declarative configuration and automation. This research designs a Google Maps API System tool for forest and land fires using a real-time database on microservices infrastructure with outputs in the form of fire locations and the results of sensor readings used. Broadly speaking, the processes that occur in the design of the location of forest fire points will be detected by sensors. Then firebase will store forest fire data which will simultaneously be updated on the website. Clients can see the point of forest fires through a browser on their respective desktops. Based on the results of the performance tests that have been carried out, it can be concluded that the use of Kubernetes microclusters can provide advantages when compared to those built monolithically, because Kubernetes microclusters have several advantages, namely having the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler feature, and the Kubernetes microcluster manages components and related services well. Then for each test performed, there was no significant change in memory usage. In the analysis of the results of the comparison data with 7 tests that have been carried out there are 6 tests which mean that the service built with the Kubernetes microcluster is superior to the monolithic one, namely hits per second 2354 ms, latency 3599 ms, response code 720 success code, cpu utilization 13.84%, error rate error rate 0.00%, and throughput 112/sec.","2832-1383","979-8-3503-9645-4","10.1109/IoTaIS56727.2022.9975953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9975953","SIG;Detector;Fire;Kubernetes;Microservices","Codes;Error analysis;Databases;Microservice architectures;Forestry;Throughput;Real-time systems","","1","","23","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cross-polarized (HV) backscatter decreased with burn severity for all frequencies. Determination coefficients were used to quantify the relationship between radar backscatter and burn severity for given intervals of local incidence angle. For X- and C-band copolarized data, higher determination coefficients were observed for slopes oriented toward the sensors, whereas for cross-polarized data, the determination coefficients were higher for slopes oriented away from the sensor. At L-band, the association strength of cross-polarized data to burn severity was high for all local incidence angles. C- and L-band cross-polarized backscatter showed better potential for burn severity estimation in the Mediterranean environment when the local incidence angle is accounted for.

Bi-temporal airborne LiDAR data acquired in August 2007 and August 2011 were used to characterize peat swamp forest changes located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We measured the tree height and Canopy Height Model (CHM) with LiDAR, segmented the canopies and then compared the tree height with the field measurements. Additionally, we collected ground field measurements at Sabangau forest transect in order to characterize some biophysical properties of different peat swamp forest physiognomies such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree-height, leaf area index (LAI), crown coverage and above ground biomass (AGB).

The cause of forest fires is caused by two factors, namely natural and human. Indicators of forest fires can be known from the appearance of hotspots or hot spots. A hotspot is an indicator of an area that has a relatively higher surface temperature than the surrounding surface temperature that has been detected by Terra / Aqua satellites with a MODIS sensor. Furthermore, the hotspots are not only randomly distributed but also clustered. The research related to the identification process of hotspot distribution patterns in an area in Sulawesi is still limited and has its novelty. Here we showed the implementation of Spatio-temporal clustering method with ST-DBSCAN algorithm, aided with Waterfall system development.

The SAR observations regardless time and atmospheric condition are superior for mapping under torrid zones such as Indonesia. The ground surface parameters including surface roughness, moisture, and dielectric constant could be derived by SAR backscattering data. However, estimating thermal properties of ground surface based on SAR remote sensing is complicated because of sensor operation in microwave region. Meanwhile, the thermal properties of ground surface are crucial for estimating surface temperature originated from natural or anthropogenic sources such volcanic activity, urban area, forest fire, or steam spots. To identify the thermal signature from the SAR data, we performed laboratory experiments by incorporating thermal property of materials to be derived from SAR parameters. The experiments were performed by heating ground surface materials including altered rocks from geothermal field and peats from dense vegetation field. We measured moisture, electric potential, magnetic susceptibility, and permeability of the samples with variation of temperature. The measured temperature was controlled by thermal camera FLIR C2 and ground thermometer FLUKE 52 up to 250°C. According to the measurement, we identified that the moisture and electric potential of materials are decrease significantly at temperature more than 100°C. An interesting phenomenon could be reported that the magnetic susceptibility and permeability response to the altered rock and peat samples temperature similarly. The increasing temperature leads to decrease magnetic susceptibility and permeability in general. The mineral and organic content of the rocks and peats controlled their magnetic properties. The laboratory measurement results were then compared to the magnetic permeability derived-SAR backscattering data at a steam field of geothermal system.","","978-1-5386-7777-3","10.1109/AGERS.2018.8554096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554096","SAR;thermal;magnetic;moisture;dielectric","Temperature measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Rocks;Land surface temperature;Synthetic aperture radar;Soil measurements;Temperature","","","","22","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many authors have demonstrated the role of remote sensing in the assessment of the equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the weight of liquid water per unit of leaf surface. However, forest fire danger models rely on fuel moisture content (FMC) as a measure of vegetation moisture. FMC is defined as the ratio of the leaf liquid water weight over the leaf dry weight. In a previous research it has been shown the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ground reflectance data in retrieving both EWT and FMC at leaf level.

This paper proposes to deploy sensor nodes in order to estimate the time-varying spread of wildfires. We propose a distributed multi-scale adaptive sampling strategy based on neural networks, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and greedy heuristics, named “EKF-NN-GAS”. This strategy combines measurements arriving at different times from sensors at different scale lengths, such as ground, air-borne or space-borne observation platforms. We use the EKF covariance matrix to derive quantitative information measures for sampling locations most likely to yield optimal information about the sampled field distribution. Furthermore, we reconstruct the spatio-temporal forest fire spread, based on parameterized Radial Basis Functions (RBF) neural networks. To replicate the complexity involved in actual fire-spread we simulate it using discrete event cellular automata acting as our “truth model”. Finally, we present experimental results with ground vehicles that navigate over a “virtual fire” projected on the lab floor from a ceiling-mounted projector to emulate a sampling mission performed by aerial robots.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-2057-5","10.1109/IROS.2008.4651083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4651083","","Fires;Robots;Mathematical model;Artificial neural networks;Sensors;Training;Robot sensing systems","","","","21","IEEE","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed system consists of: 1) an energy harvesting-assisted surveillance UAV (SUAV) that detects and reports fires and 2) multiple ground-based firefighting UAVs (FUAVs) that travel to fire spots to suppress the fire. First, the SUAV carries out the forest fire detection using the onboard color and infrared cameras. The SUAV then uses fire alarm signals to warn/inform the ground-based FUAVs to begin the firefighting mission. The goal is to inform as many FUAVs as possible as the required task (extinguishing the fire) can be completed more effectively and faster with more FUAVs. To do this, the SUAV with onboard processing capabilities makes use of the advantages of reinforcement learning. In particular, we propose a double Q-learning-based trajectory design problem that enables the energy-constrained SUAV to find the optimal sequence of FUAVs to visit (optimal flying trajectory) in order to maximize the number of informed FUAVs while considering the limited execution time, as the crucial issue is to control fire from the beginning to prevent uncontrolled spread of fire.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3227558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9975310","Energy harvesting (EH);fire warning and suppression;mission success metric;reinforcement learning (RL);trajectory optimization;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Forestry;Trajectory optimization;Wireless sensor networks;Task analysis;Navigation;Cameras;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","4","","78","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The robotic task in this paper is performed over a natural disaster, simulated as a forest fire. The simulator supports several features to allow realistic simulation, like irregular terrains, natural processes (e.g. fire, wind) and physical constraint in the creation and application of mobile robots. The proposed system relies on two steps: (i) group formation planning and (ii) intelligent techniques to perform robots navigation for fire fighting. For planning, we used genetic algorithms to evolve positioning strategies for firefighting robots performance. For robots operation, physically simulated fire-fighting robots were built, and the sensory information of each robot (e.g. GPS, compass, sonar) was used in the input of an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN controls the vehicle (robot) actuators and allows navigation with obstacle avoidance. Simulation results show that the ANN satisfactorily controls the mobile robots; the genetic algorithm adequately configures the fire fighting strategy and the proposed multi-robotic system can have an essential hole in the planning and execution of fire fighting in real forests.","","978-1-4244-5697-0","10.1109/ICIT.2010.5472498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5472498","","Intelligent control;Robot sensing systems;Fires;Artificial neural networks;Sonar navigation;Mobile robots;Intelligent robots;Strategic planning;Genetic algorithms;Robot control","","6","","42","IEEE","27 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both private and public entities, alongside governments, have engaged the most advanced technologies to safeguard and monitor forests against encroachment. This article examines the application of various drone technologies in the surveillance of forest areas. The system described herein employs drones to continuously survey forests, recording any changes, particularly in instances of encroachment or fire. The data captured are transmitted to a control unit for subsequent analysis. To circumvent the risk of task failure due to technical challenges, monitoring tasks within a predefined flight duration are allocated to the available drones. Given the critical nature of timing in the success of these tasks, this study addresses the forest monitoring challenge by seeking to minimize the maximum time required to complete all monitoring tasks. This challenge was addressed through the development of a suite of enhanced algorithms aimed at optimizing task efficiency. The primary goal of the proposed methodology is to afford the monitoring system additional time, thereby enabling the handling of an increased volume of tasks and providing support to firefighting teams in responding to forest fires. The system’s adaptability to new, unforeseen forest fire scenarios through the generation of novel solutions is also discussed. Extensive testing involving 1350 different scenarios has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing the maximum time needed for the completion of surveillance tasks by drones. The most effective algorithm was the two-group clustering algorithm (TGC), which achieved a success rate of 97.2%, with an average gap of less than 0.001 and an average computation time of 0.016 s. Furthermore, the application of this methodology to a case study of the Daintree Rainforest in Australia showcases the potential and real-world applicability of the proposed system, highlighting its performance and adaptability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3419710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10572259","Data processing;decision making;drone;fire fighting;information systems;monitoring system","Forestry;Drones;Clustering algorithms;Surveillance;Internet of Things;Global warming;Climate change;Fire safety;Fires;Environmental monitoring","","","","33","IEEE","26 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The role of the local incidence angle on the backscatter coefficient has been also studied. Burn severity was estimated by means of composition burn index plots and the remotely sensed differenced normalized burn ratio index. To infer the potential of the TSX data for burn severity assessment, the determination coefficients obtained from linear regression analysis have been used. At horizontal transmit horizontal receive (HH) polarization, backscatter increased for slopes oriented toward the sensor and areas affected by high burn severity, whereas, at horizontal transmit vertical receive (HV) polarization, higher backscatter occurred for slopes oriented away from the sensor in areas of low burn severity. The dependence of the backscatter coefficient on topography for areas affected by forest fire has been confirmed. The HH backscatter presented a clear descending trend with the increase in local incidence angle, whereas the HV backscatter presented an ascending trend. The determination coefficients showed that, at HH polarization, better estimates of burn severity are obtained at low local incidence angles, whereas, for HV polarization, the best estimates are obtained at high local incidence angles. The dual-polarized X-band SAR data showed potential for burn severity estimation in the Mediterranean environment if local incidence angle is accounted for.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2025943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256164","Burn severity;Mediterranean forest;TerraSAR-X (TSX);topography","Fires;Backscatter;Polarization;Vegetation mapping;Ecosystems;Synthetic aperture radar;Surface topography;Fuels;Testing;Linear regression","","29","","49","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Position and attitude data for the camera is collected by a global positioning system and an inertial navigation system, so that the images can be automatically geo-corrected after each flight and then distributed to end users via the Internet. Targeted scientific applications include precision agriculture, natural resource management, and disaster (e.g., flooding and forest fire) response. A multidisciplinary team of electrical and mechanical engineering students is developing the AEROCam system, with input from regional farmers and ranchers. Project management and funding are being provided by the John D.
